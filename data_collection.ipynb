The measurements are predominantly performed on proton-proton ($pp$) collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV taken from 2015 to 2018, with an integrated luminosity of up to 140 fb$^{-1}$, with some results based on $pp$ and Pb+Pb data recorded at lower nucleon centre-of-mass energies. The results cover a wide range of topics, from strong production of particles at low energies and the spectroscopy of hadrons to perturbative QCD with hadronic jets and electroweak and strong production of single and multiple vector bosons. They provide precise measurements of fundamental constants and stringent tests of the Standard Model with unprecedented precision and in energy ranges never explored before. They are also used to explore the proton structure and to perform model-independent searches for new physics.',\n",

The values of $v_2$ and $v_3$ are measured for charged particles over a wide range of transverse momentum ($p_\\\\text{T}$), 1-400 GeV, and Pb+Pb collision centrality, 0-60%, using the scalar product and multi-particle cumulant methods. These methods are sensitive to event-by-event fluctuations and non-flow effects in the measurements of azimuthal anisotropies. Positive values of $v_2$ are observed up to a $p_{\\\\text{T}}$ of approximately 100 GeV from both methods across all centrality intervals. Positive values of $v_3$ are observed up to approximately 25 GeV using both methods, though the application of three-subevent technique to the multi-particle cumulant method leads to significant changes at the highest $p_{\\\\text{T}}$. At high $p_{\\\\text{T}}$ ($p_{\\\\text{T}} \\\\gtrapprox 10$ GeV), charged particles are dominantly from jet fragmentation.

       "   'Jets with different radius parameters $R$ are an important tool to probe quantum chromodynamics processes at different angular scales. Jets with small $R=0.2$ are instrumental in measurements of the substructure of large-$R$ jets resulting from collimated hadronic decays of energetic $W$, $Z$, and Higgs bosons, top quarks, and of potential new resonances. Measurements are presented of the energy scale and resolution of jets with radius parameters $R=0.2$ and 0.6 obtained with the ATLAS detector using $37 \\\\text{fb}^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions from the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, with their associated uncertainties. A new in situ method to measure jet energy scale differences between data and Monte Carlo simulations is presented. The systematic uncertainties in the jet energy scale for central jets ($|\\\\eta| < 1.2$) typically vary from 1% to about 5% as a function of $|\\\\eta|$ at very low transverse momentum, $p_{\\\\text{T}}$, of around 20 GeV for both $R=0.2$ and 0.6 jets. The relative energy resolution ranges from $(35 \\\\pm 6)$% at $p_{\\\\text{T}} = 20$ GeV to $(6 \\\\pm 0.5)$% at $p_{\\\\text{T}} = 300$ GeV for central $R=0.2$ jets, and is found to be slightly worse for $R=0.6$ jets. Finally, the effect of close-by hadronic activity on the jet energy scale is investigated and is found to be well modelled by the ATLAS Monte Carlo simulations.',\n",

       "   'In 2022 and 2023, the Large Hadron Collider produced approximately two billion hadronic interactions each second from bunches of protons that collide at a rate of 40 MHz. The ATLAS trigger system is used to reduce this rate to a few kHz for recording. Selections based on hadronic jets, their energy, and event topology reduce the rate to $\\\\mathcal O(10)$ kHz while maintaining high efficiencies for important signatures resulting in $b$-quarks, but to reach the desired recording rate of hundreds of Hz, additional real-time selections based on the identification of jets containing $b$-hadrons ($b$-jets) are employed to achieve low thresholds on the jet transverse momentum at the High-Level Trigger. The configuration, commissioning, and performance of the real-time ATLAS $b$-jet identification algorithms for the early LHC Run 3 collision data are presented. These recent developments provide substantial gains in signal efficiency for critical signatures; for the Standard Model production of Higgs boson pairs, a 50% improvement in selection efficiency is observed in final states with four $b$-quarks or two $b$-quarks and two hadronically decaying $\\\\tau$-leptons.',\n",

       "   \"Measurements of jet substructure are key to probing the energy frontier at colliders, and many of them use track-based observables which take advantage of the angular precision of tracking detectors. Theoretical calculations of track-based observables require `track functions', which characterize the transverse momentum fraction $r_q$ carried by charged hadrons from a fragmenting quark or gluon. This letter presents a direct measurement of $r_q$ distributions in dijet events from the 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. The data are corrected for detector effects using machine-learning methods. The scale evolution of the moments of the $r_q$ distribution is sensitive to non-linear renormalization group evolution equations of QCD, and is compared with analytic predictions. When incorporated into future theoretical calculations, these results will enable a precision program of theory-data comparison for track-based jet substructure observables.\",\n",

       "   'Circularly polarized light offers opportunities to probe symmetry-dependent properties of matter such as chirality and spin. Circular dichroism measurements typically require further intrinsic or extrinsic breaking of symmetry by e.g. enantiomeric excess, orientation, magnetic fields or direction-sensitive detectors. Here we introduce circular-dichroic attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by leveraging the angular momentum of two circular-polarized pulses, both pump and probe, in an isotropic medium, optically orienting the angular momentum of excited states on an attosecond timescale. We investigate a circular-dichroic measurement of the attosecond transient absorption of He Rydberg states. By limiting the allowed pathways via dipole selection rules for co- and counter-rotating circular polarized NIR and XUV pulses, different spectral reshapings of the XUV transient absorption due to the AC Stark effect are observed. Paired with time-dependent Schr\\\\\"odinger equation calculations, the results show the role of selection and propensity rules and open up new opportunities to study coupling pathways of excited states as well as spin-dependent dynamics in atoms and beyond via attosecond optical orientation.',\n",
       "   \"Processes with $\\\\tau$-leptons in the final state are important for Standard Model measurements and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider observes $\\\\tau$-leptons produced in proton-proton collisions only through their decay products. Data analyses involving hadronically decaying $\\\\tau$-leptons face challenges due to backgrounds from jets misidentified as $\\\\tau$-leptons. These fake $\\\\tau$-leptons are not modelled reliably by Monte Carlo simulations. Data-driven methods such as the fake-factor method allow such 'fake' backgrounds to be predicted by measuring transfer factors, known as fake factors, in data from control regions. This paper describes a new technique for determining the fake factors, the Universal Fake Factor method. It evaluates the fake factors for any signal region by using fake factors from samples enriched in different sources of fake $\\\\tau$-leptons (light-quark, gluon, $b$-quark, and pile-up jets). Each fake factor is calculated as a linear combination of fake factors measured in these different enriched samples. For the full Run 2 data set, the systematic uncertainty of the calculated fake factors ranges from 15% to 35% depending on the $\\\\tau$-lepton's transverse momentum and charged-particle decay multiplicity.\",\n",

These particles are expected to move significantly slower than the speed of light. In this paper, two signal regions provide complementary sensitivity. In one region, events are selected with at least one charged-particle track with high transverse momentum, large specific ionisation measured in the pixel detector, and time of flight to the hadronic calorimeter inconsistent with the speed of light. In the other region, events are selected with at least two tracks of opposite charge which both have a high transverse momentum and an anomalously large specific ionisation. The search is sensitive to particles with lifetimes greater than about 3 ns with masses ranging from 200 GeV to 3 TeV. The results are interpreted to set constraints on the supersymmetric pair production of long-lived R-hadrons, charginos and staus, with mass limits extending beyond those from previous searches in broad ranges of lifetime.',\n",

Such an increase will create a very challenging environment in which to perform charged particle trajectory reconstruction, a task crucial for the success of the ATLAS physics program, and will exceed the capabilities of the current ATLAS Inner Detector (ID). A new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) will replace the current ID in time for the start of the HL-LHC. To ensure successful use of the ITk capabilities in Run 4 and beyond, the ATLAS tracking software has been successfully adapted to achieve state-of-the-art track reconstruction in challenging high-luminosity conditions with the ITk detector.

Building on the recent success of deep learning algorithms, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks are investigated for modelling the response of the central region of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter to photons of various energies. The properties of synthesised showers are compared with showers from a full detector simulation using geant4 . Both variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks are capable of quickly simulating electromagnetic showers with correct total energies and stochasticity, though the modelling of some shower shape distributions requires more refinement. This feasibility study demonstrates the potential of using such algorithms for ATLAS fast calorimeter simulation in the future and shows a possible way to complement current simulation techniques.',\n",

During Run 2 of the LHC, a luminosity of ℒ = 2 × 10 34 cm -2 s -1 was routinely achieved at the start of fills, twice the design luminosity. For Run 3, accelerator improvements, notably luminosity levelling, allow sustained running at an instantaneous luminosity of ℒ = 2 × 10 34 cm -2 s -1 , with an average of up to 60 interactions per bunch crossing. The ATLAS detector has been upgraded to recover Run 1 single-lepton trigger thresholds while operating comfortably under Run 3 sustained pileup conditions. A fourth pixel layer 3.3 cm from the beam axis was added before Run 2 to improve vertex reconstruction and b-tagging performance. New Liquid Argon Calorimeter digital trigger electronics, with corresponding upgrades to the Trigger and Data Acquisition system, take advantage of a factor of 10 finer granularity to improve triggering on electrons, photons, taus, and hadronic signatures through increased pileup rejection. The inner muon endcap wheels were replaced by New Small Wheels with Micromegas and small-strip Thin Gap Chamber detectors, providing both precision tracking and Level-1 Muon trigger functionality. Trigger coverage of the inner barrel muon layer near one endcap region was augmented with modules integrating new thin-gap resistive plate chambers and smaller-diameter drift-tube chambers. Tile Calorimeter scintillation counters were added to improve electron energy resolution and background rejection. Upgrades to Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators and Forward Detectors improve luminosity monitoring and enable total proton-proton cross section, diffractive physics, and heavy ion measurements. These upgrades are all compatible with operation in the much harsher environment anticipated after the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC and are the first steps towards preparing ATLAS for the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC.

       "   \"Charged particle reconstruction in the presence of many simultaneous proton-proton ($pp$) collisions in the LHC is a challenging task for the ATLAS experiment's reconstruction software due to the combinatorial complexity. This paper describes the major changes made to adapt the software to reconstruct high-activity collisions with an average of 50 or more simultaneous $pp$ interactions per bunch crossing (pile-up) promptly using the available computing resources. The performance of the key components of the track reconstruction chain and its dependence on pile-up are evaluated, and the improvement achieved compared to the previous software version is quantified. For events with an average of 60 $pp$ collisions per bunch crossing, the updated track reconstruction is twice as fast as the previous version, without significant reduction in reconstruction efficiency and while reducing the rate of combinatorial fake tracks by more than a factor two.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract The ATLAS tile calorimeter (TileCal) is the hadronic sampling calorimeter covering the central region of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This paper gives an overview of the calorimeter’s operation and performance during the years 2015–2018 (Run 2). In this period, ATLAS collected proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and the TileCal was 99.65% efficient for data-taking. The signal reconstruction, the calibration procedures, and the detector operational status are presented. The performance of two ATLAS trigger systems making use of TileCal information, the minimum-bias trigger scintillators and the tile muon trigger, is discussed. Studies of radiation effects allow the degradation of the output signals at the end of the LHC and HL-LHC operations to be estimated. Finally, the TileCal response to isolated muons, hadrons and jets from proton–proton collisions is presented. The energy and time calibration methods performed excellently, resulting in good stability and uniformity of the calorimeter response during Run 2. The setting of the energy scale was performed with an uncertainty of 2%. The results demonstrate that the performance is in accordance with specifications defined in the Technical Design Report.',\n",

The central-to-peripheral ratio of the scaled dijet yields, $R_\\\\mathrm{CP}$, is evaluated, and the results are presented as a function of variables that reflect the kinematics of the initial hard parton scattering process. The $R_\\\\mathrm{CP}$ shows a scaling with the Bjorken-$x$ of the parton originating from the proton, $x_p$, while no such trend is observed as a function of $x_\\\\mathrm{Pb}$.

An analysis based on neural network classifiers is optimised to search for directly produced pairs of supersymmetric partners of the top quark (stop), and to search for spin-0 mediators, produced in association with a pair of top quarks, that decay into dark-matter particles. In the stop search, the analysis is designed to target models in which the mass difference between the stop and the neutralino from the stop decay is close to the top quark mass. This new search is combined with previously published searches in final states with different lepton multiplicities. No significant excess above the Standard Model background is observed, and limits at 95% confidence level are set. Models with neutralinos with masses up to 570 GeV are excluded, while for small neutralino masses models are excluded for stop masses up to 1230 GeV. Scalar (pseudoscalar) dark matter mediator masses as large as 350 (370) GeV are excluded when the coupling strengths of the mediator to Standard Model and dark-matter particles are both set to one. At lower mediator masses, models with production cross-sections as small as 0.15 (0.16) times the nominal predictions are excluded. Results of this search are also used to set constraints on effective four-fermion contact interactions between top quarks and neutrinos.',\n",

The measurements are made with the ATLAS detector using an integrated luminosity of 140 fb − 1 and include measurements of dijet distributions in a region in which vector-boson fusion processes are enhanced. They are unfolded to correct for detector resolution and efficiency within the fiducial acceptance, and are designed to allow robust comparisons with a wide range of theoretical predictions. A measurement of differential cross sections for the Z → νν process is made. The measurements are generally well-described by Standard Model predictions except for the dijet invariant mass distribution. Auxiliary measurements of the hadronic system recoiling against isolated leptons, and photons, are also made in the same phase space. Ratios between the measured distributions are then derived, to take advantage of cancellations in modelling effects and some of the major systematic uncertainties. These measurements are sensitive to new phenomena, and provide a mechanism to easily set constraints on phenomenological models. To illustrate the robustness of the approach, these ratios are compared with two common Dark Matter models, where the constraints derived from the measurement are comparable to those set by dedicated detector-level searches.',\n",

       "   'Abstract The energy and mass measurements of jets are crucial tasks for the Large Hadron Collider experiments. This paper presents a new calibration method to simultaneously calibrate these quantities for large-radius jets measured with the ATLAS detector using a deep neural network (DNN). To address the specificities of the calibration problem, special loss functions and training procedures are employed, and a complex network architecture, which includes feature annotation and residual connection layers, is used. The DNN-based calibration is compared to the standard numerical approach in an extensive series of tests. The DNN approach is found to perform significantly better in almost all of the tests and over most of the relevant kinematic phase space. In particular, it consistently improves the energy and mass resolutions, with a 30% better energy resolution obtained for transverse momenta <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> <mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>500</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> GeV.',\n",

The search uses the full LHC Run 2 proton–proton collision data at s=13 TeV, corresponding to 139 fb−1 collected by the ATLAS detector. This is one of the first searches for this specific decay mode of the Higgs boson, and it probes unexplored parameter space in models with axion-like particles (ALPs) and extended scalar sectors. The mass of the a particle is assumed to be in the range 0.1–33 GeV. The data are analysed in two categories: a merged category where the photons from the a decay are reconstructed in the ATLAS calorimeter as a single cluster, and a resolved category in which two separate photons are detected. The main background processes are from Standard Model Z boson production in association with photons or jets. The data are in agreement with the background predictions, and upper limits on the branching ratio of the Higgs boson decay to Za times the branching ratio a→γγ are derived at the 95% confidence level and they range from 0.08% to 2% depending on the mass of the a particle.

Observables that are sensitive the energy-scale and angular distribution of radiation due to the strong interaction in the final state are measured double-differentially, in bins of jet multiplicity, and are unfolded to account for acceptance and detector-related effects. Additionally, the scalar sum of the two leading jets' transverse momenta is measured triple-differentially, in bins of the third jet's transverse momentum as well as bins of jet multiplicity. The measured distributions are used to construct ratios of the inclusive jet-multiplicity bins, which have been shown to be sensitive to the strong coupling $\\\\alpha_{\\\\textrm S}$ while being less sensitive than other observables to systematic uncertainties and parton distribution functions. The measured distributions are compared with state-of-the-art QCD calculations, including next-to-next-to-leading-order predictions.

       "   'Abstract Inelastic beam-gas collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), within a few hundred metres of the ATLAS experiment, are known to give the dominant contribution to beam backgrounds. These are monitored by ATLAS with a dedicated Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and with the rate of fake jets in the calorimeters. These two methods are complementary since the BCM probes backgrounds just around the beam pipe while fake jets are observed at radii of up to several metres. In order to quantify the correlation between the residual gas density in the LHC beam vacuum and the experimental backgrounds recorded by ATLAS, several dedicated tests were performed during LHC Run 2. Local pressure bumps, with a gas density several orders of magnitude higher than during normal operation, were introduced at different locations. The changes of beam-related backgrounds, seen in ATLAS, are correlated with the local pressure variation. In addition the rates of beam-gas events are estimated from the pressure measurements and pressure bump profiles obtained from calculations. Using these rates, the efficiency of the ATLAS beam background monitors to detect beam-gas events is derived as a function of distance from the interaction point. These efficiencies and characteristic distributions of fake jets from the beam backgrounds are found to be in good agreement with results of beam-gas simulations performed with the Fluka Monte Carlo programme.',\n",

       "   'The identification of top quark decays where the top quark has a large momentum transverse to the beam axis, known as $top$ $tagging$, is a crucial component in many measurements of Standard Model processes and searches for beyond the Standard Model physics at the Large Hadron Collider.

This paper presents the performance of several machine learning based top tagging algorithms on a dataset constructed from simulated proton-proton collision events measured with the ATLAS detector at $\\\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The systematic uncertainties associated with these algorithms are estimated through an approximate procedure that is not meant to be used in a physics analysis, but is appropriate for the level of precision required for this study. The most performant algorithms are found to have the largest uncertainties, motivating the development of methods to reduce these uncertainties without compromising performance.

These are monitored by ATLAS with a dedicated Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and with the rate of fake jets in the calorimeters. These two methods are complementary since the BCM probes backgrounds just around the beam pipe while fake jets are observed at radii of up to several metres. In order to quantify the correlation between the residual gas density in the LHC beam vacuum and the experimental backgrounds recorded by ATLAS, several dedicated tests were performed during LHC Run 2. Local pressure bumps, with a gas density several orders of magnitude higher than during normal operation, were introduced at different locations. The changes of beam-related backgrounds, seen in ATLAS, are correlated with the local pressure variation. In addition the rates of beam-gas events are estimated from the pressure measurements and pressure bump profiles obtained from calculations. Using these rates, the efficiency of the ATLAS beam background monitors to detect beam-gas events is derived as a function of distance from the interaction point. These efficiencies and characteristic distributions of fake jets from the beam backgrounds are found to be in good agreement with results of beam-gas simulations performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo programme.',\n",

It targets final states in which a Higgs boson decays into a photon pair, while the other Higgs or Z boson decays into a bb¯ pair, with missing transverse momentum associated with the two gravitinos. Search regions dependent on the amount of missing transverse momentum are defined by the requirements that the diphoton mass should be consistent with the mass of the Higgs boson, and the bb¯ mass with the mass of the Higgs or Z boson.

       "   'Abstract The identification of top quark decays where the top quark has a large momentum transverse to the beam axis, known as top tagging , is a crucial component in many measurements of Standard Model processes and searches for beyond the Standard Model physics at the Large Hadron Collider. Machine learning techniques have improved the performance of top tagging algorithms, but the size of the systematic uncertainties for all proposed algorithms has not been systematically studied. This paper presents the performance of several machine learning based top tagging algorithms on a dataset constructed from simulated proton-proton collision events measured with the ATLAS detector at √ s = 13 TeV. The systematic uncertainties associated with these algorithms are estimated through an approximate procedure that is not meant to be used in a physics analysis, but is appropriate for the level of precision required for this study. The most performant algorithms are found to have the largest uncertainties, motivating the development of methods to reduce these uncertainties without compromising performance. To enable such efforts in the wider scientific community, the datasets used in this paper are made publicly available.',\n",

The measurements are primarily limited by uncertainties in the modeling of inclusive $t\\\\bar{t}$ and $t\\\\bar{t}+b\\\\bar{b}$ production, in the calibration of the flavor-tagging algorithm, and by data statistics. Cross-section predictions from various $t\\\\bar{t}$ simulations are largely consistent with the measured cross-section values, though all underpredict the observed values by 0.5 to 2.0 standard deviations. In a phase-space volume without requirements on the $t\\\\bar{t}$ decay products and the jet multiplicity, the cross-section ratios of $t\\\\bar{t}+ {\\\\geq} 2c$ and $t\\\\bar{t}+1c$ to total $t\\\\bar{t}+\\\\text{jets}$ production are determined to be $(1.23 \\\\pm 0.25) \\\\%$ and $(8.8 \\\\pm 1.3) \\\\%$.',\n",

       "   \"Abstract Pixel sensors in 3D technology equip the outer ends of the staves of the Insertable B Layer (IBL), the innermost layer of the ATLAS Pixel Detector, which was installed before the start of LHC Run 2 in 2015. 3D pixel sensors are expected to exhibit more tolerance to radiation damage and are the technology of choice for the innermost layer in the ATLAS tracker upgrade for the HL-LHC programme. While the LHC has delivered an integrated luminosity of ≃ 235 fb -1 since the start of Run 2, the 3D sensors have received a non-ionising energy deposition corresponding to a fluence of ≃ 8.5 × 10 14 1 MeV neutron-equivalent cm -2 averaged over the sensor area. This paper presents results of measurements of the 3D pixel sensors' response during Run 2 and the first two years of Run 3, with predictions of its evolution until the end of Run 3 in 2025. Data are compared with radiation damage simulations, based on detailed maps of the electric field in the Si substrate, at various fluence levels and bias voltage values. These results illustrate the potential of 3D technology for pixel applications in high-radiation environments.\",\n",

       "   'The narrow bandgap semiconductor elemental tellurium (Te) has a unique electronic structure due to strong spin-orbit splitting and a lack of inversion symmetry of its helical lattice. Using broadband extreme ultraviolet core-level transient absorption, we measure simultaneously the coherently coupled photo-induced carrier and lattice dynamics at the Te N$_{4,5}$ edge initiated by a few-cycle NIR pulse. Ultrafast excitation of carriers leads to a coherently excited A$_{\\\\rm{1g}}$ phonon oscillation and the generation of a hot carrier population distribution that oscillates in temperature, and the phonon excursion and hot carrier temperature are $\\\\pi$ out of phase with respect to each other. The depths of modulation suggest a significant coupling between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in Te. A long-lived shift of the absorption edge suggests a metastable excited state of Te in a new equilibrium potential energy surface that lives on the order of the carrier recombination timescale. The observed phonon-induced oscillations of the hot carriers are supportive of a semiconductor-to-metal light-induced phase transition, whereby Te becomes more metallic with increasing phonon-induced displacement. Additionally, near the Fermi level we observe an energy-dependent phase of the displacive excitation of the A$_{\\\\rm{1g}}$ phonon mode. The discovery of coherent coupling between the lattice and hot carriers in Te provides the basis to investigate coherent interactions between spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The results spectrally and temporally resolve the correlation between photo-excited hot carriers and coherent lattice excitations, providing insight on the optical manipulation of the tellurium electronic structure at high carrier densities exceeding $10^{21}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.',\n",

       "   'Neural simulation-based inference is a powerful class of machine-learning-based methods for statistical inference that naturally handles high-dimensional parameter estimation without the need to bin data into low-dimensional summary histograms. Such methods are promising for a range of measurements, including at the Large Hadron Collider, where no single observable may be optimal to scan over the entire theoretical phase space under consideration, or where binning data into histograms could result in a loss of sensitivity. This work develops a neural simulation-based inference framework for statistical inference, using neural networks to estimate probability density ratios, which enables the application to a full-scale analysis. It incorporates a large number of systematic uncertainties, quantifies the uncertainty due to the finite number of events in training samples, develops a method to construct confidence intervals, and demonstrates a series of intermediate diagnostic checks that can be performed to validate the robustness of the method. As an example, the power and feasibility of the method are assessed on simulated data for a simplified version of an off-shell Higgs boson couplings measurement in the four-lepton final states. This approach represents an extension to the standard statistical methodology used by the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, and can benefit many physics analyses.',\n",
       "   'The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider explores the use of modern neural networks for a multi-dimensional calibration of its calorimeter signal defined by clusters of topologically connected cells (topo-clusters). The Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach not only yields a continuous and smooth calibration function that improves performance relative to the standard calibration but also provides uncertainties on the calibrated energies for each topo-cluster. The results obtained by using a trained BNN are compared to the standard local hadronic calibration and to a calibration provided by training a deep neural network. The uncertainties predicted by the BNN are interpreted in the context of a fractional contribution to the systematic uncertainties of the trained calibration. They are also compared to uncertainty predictions obtained from an alternative estimator employing repulsive ensembles.',\n",
       "   'A bstract During the 2015–2018 data-taking period, the Large Hadron Collider delivered proton-proton bunch crossings at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV to the ATLAS experiment at a rate of roughly 30 MHz, where each bunch crossing contained an average of 34 independent inelastic proton-proton collisions. The ATLAS trigger system selected roughly 1 kHz of these bunch crossings to be recorded to disk. Offline algorithms then identify one of the recorded collisions as the collision of interest for subsequent data analysis, and the remaining collisions are referred to as pile-up. Pile-up collisions represent a trigger-unbiased dataset, which is evaluated to have an integrated luminosity of 1.33 pb − 1 in 2015–2018. This is small compared with the normal trigger-based ATLAS dataset, but when combined with vertex-by-vertex jet reconstruction it provides up to 50 times more dijet events than the conventional single-jet-trigger-based approach, and does so without adding any additional cost or requirements on the trigger system, readout, or storage. The pile-up dataset is validated through comparisons with a special trigger-unbiased dataset recorded by ATLAS, and its utility is demonstrated by means of a measurement of the jet energy resolution in dijet events, where the statistical uncertainty is significantly reduced for jet transverse momenta below 65 GeV.',\n",

Material and Methods: a retrospective single institution of 482 stage II and III breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on anthracycline and taxans plus antiHEr2 in those Her2 positive cases. Survival was calculated at 5 and 10 years. Kaplan Meier with log rank test were calculated for difference according to TNM, pathological and molecular surrogated subtype, TILs cut-off 20%, response to chemotherapy and the presence of vascular invasion. Results: In the univariate those factors that influenced long-term patient outcome were TNM (p=0.000); pathologic subtype (p=0.003); Tils cut off 20%; achieving pCR (p=0.000), RCB (p=0.000) and vascular invasion (p=0.000). After a mean follow up of 126 months, Luminal tumors presented a substantial difference of survival rates calculated at 5 or 10 years (81.2% compared to 74.7%) whereas for TNBC was 75.3 and 73.5, respectively. The greatest difference was seen according to response those patients with pCR presented a 10yDDFS of 95.5 vs 72.4% for those patients without pCR. This difference was especially meaningful in TNBC were 10y DDFS according to the RCB 0 to 3 was 100%, 80.6%, 69% and 49.2% respectively. Patients with a special bad prognosis in our series were lobular carcinomas with 10y DDFS of 42.9% vs 79.7%, p= 0.001 for ductal carcinomas; and those patients with vascular invasion at the surgical specimen with a 10yDDFS of 59.2% vs 83.6, p=0.,000 for those patients without vascular invasion. Conclusion: long-term outcomes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can help patient and clinician make well-informed decisions.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Emerging from the superposition principle, the resource theory of coherence plays a crucial role in many information-processing tasks. Recently, a generalization to this resource theory was investigated with respect to arbitrary positive operator valued measurement (POVM) based on Naimark's dilation theorem. Here, we introduce the notion of Block Incoherent Operations (BIO), Strictly Block Incoherent Operations (SBIO) and Physically Block Incoherent Operations (PBIO) and provide an analytical expression for Kraus operators of these operations to have a better understanding of the resource theory of block coherence which in turn gives a more clear picture of POVM based resource theory of coherence. A dilation theorem corresponding to SBIO has been introduced to enlighten the proper physical interpretation of this operation. These free operations will be helpful in finding out the conditions of state transformations and could be implemented in various protocols. For a transparent view of this resource theory, we have successfully introduced the concept of state transformation under SBIO.\",\n",
       "   'Obeying precise constraints on top of multiple external attributes is a common computational problem underlying seemingly different domains, from controlled text generation to protein engineering. Existing language model (LM) controllability methods for multi-attribute constraint satisfaction often rely on specialized architectures or gradient-based classifiers, limiting their flexibility to work with arbitrary black-box evaluators and pretrained models. Current general-purpose large language models, while capable, cannot achieve fine-grained multi-attribute control over external attributes. Thus, we create Multi-Attribute Constraint Satisfaction (MACS), a generalized method capable of finetuning language models on any sequential domain to satisfy user-specified constraints on multiple external real-value attributes. Our method trains LMs as editors by sampling diverse multi-attribute edit pairs from an initial set of paraphrased outputs. During inference, LM iteratively improves upon its previous solution to satisfy constraints for all attributes by leveraging our designed constraint satisfaction reward. We additionally experiment with reward-weighted behavior cloning to further improve the constraint satisfaction rate of LMs. To evaluate our approach, we present a new Fine-grained Constraint Satisfaction (FineCS) benchmark, featuring two challenging tasks: (1) Text Style Transfer, where the goal is to simultaneously modify the sentiment and complexity of reviews, and (2) Protein Design, focusing on modulating fluorescence and stability of Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP). Our empirical results show that MACS achieves the highest threshold satisfaction in both FineCS tasks, outperforming strong domain-specific baselines. Our work opens new avenues for generalized and real-value multi-attribute control, with implications for diverse applications spanning NLP and bioinformatics.'],\n",

The result is based on positive muon data taken at Fermilab's Muon Campus during the 2019 and 2020 accelerator runs. The measurement uses $3.1$ GeV$/c$ polarized muons stored in a $7.1$-m-radius storage ring with a $1.45$ T uniform magnetic field. The value of $ a_{\\\\mu}$ is determined from the measured difference between the muon spin precession frequency and its cyclotron frequency. This difference is normalized to the strength of the magnetic field, measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The ratio is then corrected for small contributions from beam motion, beam dispersion, and transient magnetic fields. We measure $a_\\\\mu = 116 592 057 (25) \\\\times 10^{-11}$ (0.21 ppm). This is the world's most precise measurement of this quantity and represents a factor of $2.2$ improvement over our previous result based on the 2018 dataset. In combination, the two datasets yield $a_\\\\mu(\\\\text{FNAL}) = 116 592 055 (24) \\\\times 10^{-11}$ (0.20 ppm). Combining this with the measurements from Brookhaven National Laboratory for both positive and negative muons, the new world average is $a_\\\\mu$(exp) $ = 116 592 059 (22) \\\\times 10^{-11}$ (0.19 ppm).\",\n",
       "   \"Abstract The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next generation experiment aimed to study neutrino oscillation. Its long-baseline configuration will exploit a Near Detector (ND) and a Far Detector (FD) located at a distance of ∼1300 km.

A Photon Detection System (PDS) will be used to detect the scintillation light produced inside the detector after neutrino interactions. The PDS will be based on light collectors coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). Different photosensor technologies have been proposed and produced in order to identify the best samples to fullfill the experiment requirements. In this paper, we present the procedure and results of a validation campaign for the Hole Wire Bonding (HWB) MPPCs samples produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.

       "   'Every sub-detector in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, including Liquid Argon and TileCal, writes conditions and calibration data into an ORACLE Database (DB). In order to provide an interface for reliable interactions both with the Conditions Online and Offline DBs a unique semiautomatic web based application, TileCalibWeb Robot, has been developed. TileCalibWeb is being used in LHC Run 3 by ATLAS Calorimeter data preparation, data quality and calibration experts as well as by shifters on duty. The architecture and functionality of the tool is discussed. Use cases for updating the conditions data of various types and formats are presented. The interface provides the user with the option to choose the strategy of the DB update. Options include a short text input typed directly into the browser as well as more complicated methods using data files prepared in advance. TileCalibWeb significantly simplifies the procedure of the preparation and writing of conditions and calibration data both into Online and Offline DBs in parallel, verifies user input and automatically publishes bookkeeping records.'],\n",

       "   'Given the renewed interest in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and the intensified search for improved boron carriers, as well as the difficulties of coherently comparing the carriers described so far, it seems necessary to define a basic set of assays and standardized methods to be used in the early stages of boron carrier development in vitro. The selection of assays and corresponding methods is based on the practical experience of the authors and is certainly not exhaustive, but open to discussion. The proposed tests/characteristics: Solubility, lipophilicity, stability, cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake apply to both low molecular weight (up to 500 Da) and high molecular weight (5000 Da and more) boron carriers. However, the specific methods have been selected primarily for low molecular weight boron carriers; in the case of high molecular weight compounds, some of the methods may need to be adapted.',\n",

       "   'ABSTRACT Targeted charged alpha‐ and beta‐particle therapies are currently being used in clinical radiation treatments as newly developed methods for either killing or controlling tumor cell growth. The alpha particles can be generated either through a nuclear decay reaction or in situ by a nuclear fission reaction such as the boron neutron capture reaction. Different strategies have been employed to improve the selectivity and delivery of radiation dose to tumor cells based on the source of the clinically used alpha particles. As a result, the side effects of the treatment can be minimized. The increasing attention and research efforts on targeted alpha‐particle therapy have been fueled by exciting results of both academic research and clinical trials. It is highly anticipated that alpha‐particle therapy will improve the efficacy of treating malignant tumors. In this overview, we compare radionuclide drug conjugates (RDC) with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) to present recent developments in targeted alpha‐particle therapy.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract The ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector has been taking physics data since 2022 as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program. This paper details the equalization of the response to charge in the ICARUS time projection chamber (TPC), as well as data-driven tuning of the simulation of ionization charge signals and electronics noise. The equalization procedure removes non-uniformities in the ICARUS TPC response to charge in space and time. This work leverages the copious number of cosmic ray muons available to ICARUS at the surface. The ionization signal shape simulation applies a novel procedure that tunes the simulation to match what is measured in data. The end result of the equalization procedure and simulation tuning allows for a comparison of charge measurements in ICARUS between Monte Carlo simulation and data, showing good performance with minimal residual bias between the two.',\n",
       "   'Abstract This paper reports on a measurement of electron-ion recombination in liquid argon in the ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC). A clear dependence of recombination on the angle of the ionizing particle track relative to the drift electric field is observed. An ellipsoid modified box (EMB) model of recombination describes the data across all measured angles. These measurements are used for the calorimetric energy scale calibration of the ICARUS TPC, which is also presented.

       "   'The ICARUS liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector has been taking physics data since 2022 as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program. This paper details the equalization of the response to charge in the ICARUS time projection chamber (TPC), as well as data-driven tuning of the simulation of ionization charge signals and electronics noise. The equalization procedure removes non-uniformities in the ICARUS TPC response to charge in space and time. This work leverages the copious number of cosmic ray muons available to ICARUS at the surface. The ionization signal shape simulation applies a novel procedure that tunes the simulation to match what is measured in data. The end result of the equalization procedure and simulation tuning allows for a comparison of charge measurements in ICARUS between Monte Carlo simulation and data, showing good performance with minimal residual bias between the two.',\n",

This source was revealed by previous NOEMA observations to be a binary system of dusty star-forming galaxies at z = 2.3, with the east component (HerBS-70E) hosting an active galactic nucleus. The SCUBA-2 observations detected, in addition to the binary system, 21 sources at &amp;gt;3.5σ over an area of ∼25 square comoving Mpc with a sensitivity of 1σ850 = 0.75 mJy. The surface density of continuum sources around HerBS-70 is three times higher than for field galaxies. The NOEMA spectroscopic measurements confirm the protocluster membership of three of the nine brightest sources through their CO(4–3) line emission, yielding a volume density 36 times higher than for field galaxies. All five confirmed sub-mm galaxies in the HerBS-70 system have relatively short gas depletion times (80−500 Myr), indicating the onset of quenching for this protocluster core due to the depletion of gas. The dark matter halo mass of the HerBS-70 system is estimated around 5 × 1013 M⊙, with a projected current-day mass of 1015 M⊙, similar to the local Virgo and Coma clusters. These observations support the claim that DSFGs, in particular the ones with observed multiplicity, can trace cosmic overdensities.',\n",

Based on the achieved sensitivity, we believe that this technique of stacking LIM data on the positions of traditional galaxy or quasar catalogs is extremely promising, both as a technique for investigating large galaxy catalogs efficiently at high redshift and as a technique for bolstering the sensitivity of LIM experiments, even with a fraction of their total expected survey data.',\n",
       "   \"We present updated constraints on the cosmological 3D power spectrum of carbon monoxide CO(1--0) emission in the redshift range $2.4$--$3.4$. The constraints are derived from the two first seasons of Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder line intensity mapping observations aiming to trace star formation during the epoch of galaxy assembly. These results improve on the previous Early Science results through both increased data volume and an improved data processing methodology. On the methodological side, we now perform cross-correlations between groups of detectors (``feed groups''), as opposed to cross-correlations between single feeds, and this new feed group pseudo power spectrum (FGPXS) is constructed to be more robust against systematic effects. In terms of data volume, the effective mapping speed is significantly increased due to an improved observational strategy as well as a better data selection methodology. The updated spherically and field-averaged FGPXS, $ C (k)$, is consistent with zero, at a probability-to-exceed of around $34\\\\,&lt;!PCT!&gt;$, with an excess of $2.7\\\\ in the most sensitive bin. Our power spectrum estimate is about an order of magnitude more sensitive in our six deepest bins across Mpc &lt; k &lt; 0.73\\\\ Mpc $, compared to the feed-feed pseudo power spectrum (FPXS) of COMAP ES. Each of these bins individually constrains the CO power spectrum to $ kP_ CO (k)&lt; 2400-4900\\\\ K^2 $ at $95\\\\,&lt;!PCT!&gt;$ confidence. To monitor potential contamination from residual systematic effects, we analyzed a set of 312 difference-map null tests and found that these are consistent with the instrumental noise prediction. In sum, these results provide the strongest direct constraints on the cosmological 3D CO(1--0) power spectrum published to date.\",\n",
       "   'Background Healthcare laboratory systems produce and capture a vast array of information, yet do not always report all of this to the national infrastructure within the United Kingdom. The global COVID-19 pandemic brought about a much greater need for detailed healthcare data, one such instance being laboratory testing data. The reporting of qualitative laboratory test results (e.g. positive, negative or indeterminate) provides a basic understanding of levels of seropositivity. However, to better understand and interpret seropositivity, how it is determined and other factors that affect its calculation (i.e. levels of antibodies), quantitative laboratory test data are needed. Method 36 data attributes were collected from 3 NHS laboratories and 29 CO-CONNECT project partner organisations. These were assessed against the need for a minimum dataset to determine data attribute importance. An NHS laboratory feasibility study was undertaken to assess the minimum data standard, together with a literature review of national and international data standards and healthcare reports. Results A COVID serology minimum data standard (CSMDS) comprising 12 data attributes was created and verified by 3 NHS laboratories to allow national granular reporting of COVID serology results. To support this, a standardised set of vocabulary terms was developed to represent laboratory analyser systems and laboratory information management systems. Conclusions This paper puts forward a minimum viable standard for COVID-19 serology data attributes to enhance its granularity and augment the national reporting of COVID-19 serology laboratory results, with implications for future pandemics.',\n",

       "   \"Additive Manufacturing (AM) presents a ground-breaking opportunity to produce lightweight parts with enhanced functionality and design flexibility. It revolutionizes assembly by enabling integrated designs that significantly reduce component counts, minimizing assembly efforts and potential faults. Consequently, AM stands out as an appealing choice for manufacturing aerospace engine parts. Among AM techniques for metal parts, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), also known as Direct Metal Laser Melting (DMLM), currently dominates the industry due to its capability to achieve high part quality and density using advanced machinery. However, limitations in part size stem from the build envelopes of these machines. Hence, this study explores the feasibility of printing large-scale engine parts, covering the design process, additive manufacturing, and aerothermal testing. A turbine center frame, nearly one meter in diameter, serves as a demonstrator case. Employing a multi-objective Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) approach, the frame's structure underwent optimization through generative design, aiming to minimize mass, maximize stiffness, and meet strength requirements. Furthermore, the manifold section of the frame was optimized to reduce system pressure loss within the designated design space. Inconel 718 using LPBF was selected, with initial segments confirming manufacturability. The manufacturing process was fine-tuned for productivity and part properties, establishing design guidelines accordingly. Subsequently, the optimized manifold design underwent successful aerothermal testing on a specific test rig under various flow conditions. The redesigned frame showcased a 34% weight reduction and a 91% decrease in pressure loss while consolidating over 100 parts into one assembly. For the production, two alternatives are discussed. On the one hand, the final design was printed using the GE Additive ATLAS, the largest available LPBF system, validating the AM feasibility for large-scale parts under controlled laboratory conditions. On the other hand, a modified design is proposed that allows for the printing of segments on a regular-sized AM machine and a subsequent welding.\",\n",

In the nuclear bar region, the intensity distributions of 12 CO(1–0) and 13 CO(1–0) emission trace moderate densities, and differ from the dense gas distributions sampled in C 18 O(1–0), HCN(1–0), and HCO + (1–0). We observe a constant HCN(1–0)-to-HCO + (1–0) ratio of 1.2 ± 0.1 across the whole ∼1 kpc bar.

       "   'The realm of science and its outcomes is frequently perceived as esoteric by individuals outside the scientific field. This perception largely stems from the presentation of results, as scientists often convey their findings in a refined manner using strong technical terminology. However, this approach can be challenging for individuals with diverse backgrounds, both within and outside the scientific field. The absence of comprehension isolates such scientific work from our everyday life experiences, resulting in limited applicability and utilization of its findings. Hence, it is crucial to discover means of conveying research and findings in a more accessible and engaging manner. Achieving this can foster greater societal involvement in research, promoting participatory science&amp;#8212;an integral yet often undervalued scientific endeavour. Geoheritage bridges geoscience and society, facilitating the accessible communication of geoscientific results. In our study, we create three levels of simple and clear explanations (doing, seeing and theory) to illustrate one of the most useful techniques in studying the rock-forming process, AMS (Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility), to all based on their background. AMS is an extremely useful technique with diverse applications, including identifying strain and flow sense in rocks. We studied three distinct volcanic settings serving different visitor contexts&amp;#8212;wild trekkers, beach visitors, and walkers and created an inventory that includes both tangible geological features of outcrops and intangible elements (AMS results). The M-GAM technique enabled us to create a comprehensive geoheritage inventory and to identify the most likely candidates for presenting these results effectively to the community, ensuring an optimal strategy for subsequent outreach and interaction with both tourists and locals. This method could be useful for studies involving a wider public, using their input in the simple explanations stage to con-construct a narrative that can then be consolidated with the inventory alongside the science.',\n",
       "   'Abstract The first introduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into a new carbon capture and storage (CCS) pipeline is one of the most onerous operations over the asset lifecycle. The emergence of CCS hubs and terminals introduce additional technical challenges for CO2 system operation due to varying CO2 source and composition. The paper addresses a key operation which is a known risk for these emerging projects and provides valuable mitigation insights based on real project design experience. The objective of this paper is to share insights from CCS project initial start-up planning case studies to educate on systems risks and mitigation measures related to this operation. The case studies show that adequately designing for first fill operational flexibility has a first order impact on the pipeline design, and therefore has the potential to result in cost growth if not accounted for early in design. The initial pressure drop from a source of higher-pressure CO2 to an initially lower pipeline pressure can result in very low transient operating temperatures as the CO2 phase changes and expands to lower pressure gas, giving rise to risks to mechanical integrity of the pipeline and risk of water dropout leading to wet CO2 corrosion risks. As the pipeline is then subsequently pressurized, the conversion of lower density gaseous CO2 to higher density liquid CO2 can be an unexpected constraint to commissioning schedule estimates, taking an order of magnitude longer than simple linear predictions might estimate. This paper presents case studies around these challenges, example methods of assessment for predicting these behaviors, and examples of the design and operational levers available to the project design team to plan around these challenges for successful pipeline commissioning. The case studies and example assessment methods presented in this paper consider: The impact that the source of CO2 has, comparing liquid CO2 from vessel transport conditions vs CO2 sourced directly from an emitter. The impact of fluid impurities, comparing a CO2-rich fluid (96 mol% CO2) to a pure CO2 fluid. Dehydration requirements of first fill. The effectiveness that heating the CO2 or sourcing the CO2 from a higher temperature source has on mitigating low temperatures. The effectiveness of increasing the initial pipeline pressure through an initial partial pressurization with dry air or nitrogen. Constraints that may occur due to repurposing an existing hydrocarbon pipeline as compared to a new greenfield pipeline.',\n",

We present an improved version of the COMAP data processing pipeline and apply this to the first two seasons of observations. This analysis improves on the COMAP Early Science (ES) results in several key aspects. On the observational side, all second season scans were made in constant-elevation mode, after noting that the previous Lissajous scans were associated with increased systematic errors; those scans accounted for 50% of the total Season 1 data volume. Secondly, all new observations were restricted to an elevation range of 35-65 degrees, to minimize sidelobe ground pickup. On the data processing side, more effective data cleaning in both the time- and map-domain has allowed us to eliminate all data-driven power spectrum-based cuts. This increases the overall data retention and reduces the risk of signal subtraction bias. On the other hand, due to the increased sensitivity, two new pointing-correlated systematic errors have emerged, and we introduce a new map-domain PCA filter to suppress these. Subtracting only 5 out of 256 PCA modes, we find that the standard deviation of the cleaned maps decreases by 67% on large angular scales, and after applying this filter, the maps appear consistent with instrumental noise. Combining all these improvements, we find that each hour of raw Season 2 observations yields on average 3.2 times more cleaned data compared to ES analysis. Combining this with the increase in raw observational hours, the effective amount of data available for high-level analysis is a factor of 8 higher than in ES.

       "   'The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at $z\\\\sim3$ to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at $\\\\langle{Tb}\\\\rangle<4.8$ $\\\\mu$K. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo-CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.',\n",
       "   'In the era of Big Data, scalable and accurate clustering algorithms for high-dimensional data are essential. We present new Bayesian Distance Clustering (BDC) models and inference algorithms with improved scalability while maintaining the predictive accuracy of modern Bayesian non-parametric models. Unlike traditional methods, BDC models the distance between observations rather than the observations directly, offering a compromise between the scalability of distance-based methods and the enhanced predictive power and probabilistic interpretation of model-based methods. However, existing BDC models still rely on performing inference on the partition model to group observations into clusters. The support of this partition model grows exponentially with the dataset\\'s size, complicating posterior space exploration and leading to many costly likelihood evaluations. Inspired by K-medoids, we propose using tessellations in discrete space to simplify inference by focusing the learning task on finding the best tessellation centers, or \"medoids.\" Additionally, we extend our models to effectively handle multi-view data, such as data comprised of clusters that evolve across time, enhancing their applicability to complex datasets. The real data application in numismatics demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.',\n",

This increases the overall data retention and reduces the risk of signal subtraction bias. However, due to the increased sensitivity, two new pointing-correlated systematic errors have emerged, and we introduced a new map-domain PCA filter to suppress these errors. Subtracting only five out of 256 PCA modes, we find that the standard deviation of the cleaned maps decreases by 67% on large angular scales, and after applying this filter, the maps appear consistent with instrumental noise. Combining all of these improvements, we find that each hour of raw Season 2 observations yields on average 3.2 times more cleaned data compared to the ES analysis. Combining this with the increase in raw observational hours, the effective amount of data available for high-level analysis is a factor of eight higher than in the ES analysis. The resulting maps have reached an uncertainty of 25–50 μK per voxel, providing by far the strongest constraints on cosmological CO line emission published to date.',\n",
       "   'The Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder survey continues to demonstrate the feasibility of line-intensity mapping using high-redshift carbon monoxide (CO) line emission traced at cosmological scales. The latest COMAP Pathfinder power spectrum analysis is based on observations through the end of Season 2, covering the first three years of Pathfinder operations. We use our latest constraints on the CO(1–0) line-intensity power spectrum at z ~ 3 to update corresponding constraints on the cosmological clustering of CO line emission and thus the cosmic molecular gas content at a key epoch of galaxy assembly. We first mirror the COMAP Early Science interpretation, considering how Season 2 results translate to limits on the shot noise power of CO fluctuations and the bias of CO emission as a tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution. The COMAP Season 2 results place the most stringent limits on the CO tracer bias to date, at ⟨ T b ⟩ &lt; 4.8 μK, which translates to a molecular gas density upper limit of ρ H2 &lt; 1.6 × 10 8 M ⊙ Mpc −3 at z ~ 3 given additional model assumptions. These limits narrow the model space significantly compared to previous CO line-intensity mapping results while maintaining consistency with small-volume interferometric surveys of resolved line candidates. The results also express a weak preference for CO emission models used to guide fiducial forecasts from COMAP Early Science, including our data-driven priors. We also consider directly constraining a model of the halo–CO connection, and show qualitative hints of capturing the total contribution of faint CO emitters through the improved sensitivity of COMAP data. With continued observations and matching improvements in analysis, the COMAP Pathfinder remains on track for a detection of cosmological clustering of CO emission.',\n",
       "   'In this work we investigate the application of advanced object detection techniques to digital numismatics, focussing on the analysis of historical coins. Leveraging models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), we develop a flexible framework for identifying and classifying specific coin features using both image and textual descriptions. By examining two distinct datasets, modern Russian coins featuring intricate \"Saint George and the Dragon\" designs and degraded 1st millennium AD Southeast Asian coins bearing Hindu-Buddhist symbols, we evaluate the efficacy of different detection algorithms in search and classification tasks. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of larger CLIP models in detecting complex imagery, while traditional methods excel in identifying simple geometric patterns. Additionally, we propose a statistical calibration mechanism to enhance the reliability of similarity scores in low-quality datasets. This work highlights the transformative potential of integrating state-of-the-art object detection into digital numismatics, enabling more scalable, precise, and efficient analysis of historical artifacts. These advancements pave the way for new methodologies in cultural heritage research, artefact provenance studies, and the detection of forgeries.'],\n",

       "   'Relativistic charged-particle beams that generate intense longitudinal fields in accelerating structures also inherently couple to transverse modes. The effects of this coupling may lead to beam breakup instability and thus must be countered to preserve beam quality in applications such as linear colliders. Beams with highly asymmetric transverse sizes (flat beams) have been shown to suppress the initial instability in slab-symmetric structures. However, as the coupling to transverse modes remains, this solution serves only to delay instability. In order to understand the hazards of transverse coupling in such a case, we describe here an experiment characterizing the transverse effects on a flat beam, traversing near a planar dielectric lined structure. The measurements reveal the emergence of a previously unobserved skew-quadrupolelike interaction when the beam is canted transversely, which is not present when the flat beam travels parallel to the dielectric surface. We deploy a multipole field fitting algorithm to reconstruct the projected transverse wakefields from the data. We generate the effective kick vector map using a simple two-particle theoretical model, with particle-in-cell simulations used to provide further insight for realistic particle distributions.',\n",

Jarvis et al., Nature (London) 608, 287 (2022)]. This paper describes the numerical implementation of the OSC process in the particle-tracking program elegant and discusses the validation of the developed model with available experimental data. The model is also employed to highlight some features associated with different modes of operation of OSC. The developed simulation tool should be valuable in guiding future configurations of optical stochastic cooling and, more broadly, modeling self-field-based beam manipulations.',\n",

The development of ANAs is conducted at universities and national laboratories worldwide. The community is thematically broad and diverse, in particular since lasers suitable for ANA research (multi-hundred-terawatt peak power, a few tens of femtosecond-long pulses) and acceleration of electrons to hundreds of mega electron volts to multi giga electron volts became commercially available. The community spans several continents (Europe, America, Asia), including more than 62 laboratories in more than 20 countries. It is among the missions of the ICFA-ANA panel to feature the amazing progress made with ANAs, to provide international coordination and to foster international collaborations towards a future HEP collider. The scope of this edition of the workshop was to discuss the recent progress and necessary steps towards realizing a linear collider for particle physics based on novel-accelerator technologies (laser or beam driven in plasma or structures). Updates on the relevant aspects of the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) Roadmap Process as well as of the P5 (in the US) were presented, and ample time was dedicated to discussions. The major outcome of the workshop is the decision for ALEGRO to coordinate efforts in Europe, in the US, and in Asia towards a pre-CDR for an ANA-based, 10\\\\,TeV CM collider. This goal of this coordination is to lead to a funding proposal to be submitted to both EU and EU/US funding agencies.

The influence of the method of a Mo-Al-B-powder reaction mixture preparation on the combustion temperature, mechanism, and stages of the MAB phase formation in the combustion process was investigated. The combustion temperatures of the mixtures obtained in the rotary ball mill and high-speed planetary ball mill were 1234 and 992 °C, respectively. The formation of intermediate compounds Mo3Al8 and α-MoB in the combustion front, along with MoAlB, was established using the time-resolved X-ray diffraction method. In the case of the mixture prepared in a ball mill, the primary interaction in the combustion front occurred through the Al melt, and in the case of using a planetary mill, solid-phase reactions played an important role. The mechanical activation of the mixture in a planetary mill also accelerated the processes of phase formation. The method of a reaction mixture preparation has virtually no effect on the MoAlB MAB phase content in combustion products (92-94%), but it does affect their structure. The synthesis products have a lamellar structure composed of MAB grains with a thickness of ~0.4 μm and a length of ~2-10 μm.',\n",

       "   'In this report, the effect of Ti addition on the phase evolution of a near‐equiatomic CoCrFeNi‐based high‐entropy alloy (HEA) during annealing in a vacuum is described. The HEA Co 0.22 Cr 0.23 Fe 0.29 Ni 0.20 Ti 0.06 is synthesized through mechanical alloying of constituent elements for a milling duration of 1 h. The as‐prepared HEA is a two‐phase alloy containing body centred cubic (BCC) precipitates in an face centred cubic (FCC) matrix. The thermal stability of the HEA is experimentally studied by subjecting it to 5 h of isothermal annealing at 600, 800, and 1000 °C, using high‐temperature X‐ray diffraction (HTXRD). The HTXRD analysis indicates a noteworthy reduction in the BCC phase content after isothermal annealing at 600 °C. The formation of intermetallic σ‐phases does not occur. At temperatures of 800 and 1000 °C, the alloy matrix exhibits a single‐phase FCC solid solution. At 800 and 1000 °C, HEA undergoes partial oxidation, resulting in the formation of oxide phases on the surface and within the particles of the powder in the form of nanoscale inclusions. This oxidation depletes the metal matrix with titanium, leading to a change in the composition of the HEA. The alloy transforms into a CoCrFeNi solid solution containing 3–4 at% Ti. Thus, the alloy matrix phase remains a stable FCC solid solution.',\n",
       "   'Abstract The combination of social and environmental stressors significantly influences psychological and physical health in males and females, and contributes to both depression and cardiovascular diseases. Animal models support these findings. Voluntary exercise may protect against some forms of stress; however, the protective effects of exercise against social stressors require further investigation. This study evaluated the influence of exercise on the impact of combined social and environmental stressors in socially monogamous prairie voles. Following a period of social isolation plus additional chronic environmental stress, prairie voles were either allowed access to a running wheel in a larger cage for 2 weeks or remained in sedentary conditions. A behavioral stress task was conducted prior to and following exercise or sedentary conditions. Heart rate (HR) and HR variability were evaluated after exercise or sedentary conditions. Group‐based analyses indicated that exercise prevented elevated resting HR and promoted autonomic control of the heart. Exercise was also effective against social and environmental stress‐induced forced swim test immobility. Some minor sex differences in behavior were observed in response to exercise intensity. This research informs our understanding of the protective influence of physical exercise against social and environmental stressors in male and female humans.',\n",

       "   \"Bulk CoCrFeNiCu-based high entropy alloy was fabricated using a combination of short-term high energy ball milling and rapid spark plasma sintering. Extensive studies by using x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, alongside with energy-dispersive and electron energy loss-spectroscopies revealed that the fabricated material possesses a unique hierarchical structure. The structure involves a multicomponent Cu-depleted fcc-solid solution with extremely thin (~ 1-10 nm) layers of the Cu-based phase, primarily located on the grain boundaries. In addition, Cr2O3 nano-precipitates are uniformly distributed throughout the grain volume. Such complex hierarchical structure contributes to the unique material properties: yield strength 1205±20 MPa, bending strength 1362±62 MPa and Vicker's micro hardness 4.86 ± 0.63 GPa. Nano-hardness and reduced modulus measured by nano-indentation provided values of 6.3±0.2 GPa and 160±3 GPa, respectively. Furthermore, the alloy was found to exhibit ferromagnetic properties. The results obtained were compared with previously reported data, and the details of the fabrication process and how it impacts the material properties were discussed.\",\n",

       "   'The purpose of this study was to analyze the aftereffects of a set of engineering measures to implement the so-called “Nature Transformation Plan” on the territory of the forest-steppe zone of Central Russia (Tambov, Lipetsk, Voronezh oblasts) based on archival materials of drilling logs of 1900-1914, archival documents of 1949-1953, as well as the results of soil and hydrological studies in 2015-2023. The results of chemical analysis of groundwater 1914 and 2015 found that the chemical composition of the aquifer water - hydrocarbonate-sodium - has not changed significantly over the 100-year period, only a slight decrease in total water hardness and an increasing trend in sulfate and chloride content. It is shown that the stage of anthropogenic development of Tambov region by construction of ponds, forest strips and introduction of irrigation in the course of implementation of Stalin’s plan of nature transformation without taking into account the specifics of hydrology of the region has led to the rise of the level of hydrocarbonate-sodium groundwater by 2-3 m, to the complete, not temporary, destruction of the “dead horizon” in chernozems and will contribute to further deterioration of their properties.',\n",

The challenge lies in breaking and restoring metal-sulfur bonds and allowing rapid ionic transport. Here we explore the boundary of conversion- and intercalation-type metal sulfides to develop ideal sodium-ion storage materials. We focus on sulfides of vanadium and chromium because of their adjacent atomic numbers but different energy storage mechanism. Among various sulfides of vanadium and chromium, a loosely packed bimetallic sulfide, Cr0.99V1.8S4, with cationic vacancies and metallic conductivity (4.28 S m-1), shows optimal sodium-ion storage performance: an initial Coulombic efficiency of 95.6%, a reversible capacity of 551 mAh g-1 at 1.6 C, and maintaining 100% capacity after 600 cycles at a high rate of 16-66 C.',\n",

The crystal structure of Hf 7 Pd 7 Ga 3 features a Pd–Ga framework built of sinusoidal layers of Pd and Ga, which stack along the b axis sandwiching the Hf atoms. Density functional theory calculations for Hf 7 Pd 7 Ga 3 in an idealized, ordered structure and, for comparison, hypothetical Hf 7 Pd 10 reveal that partial substitution of Pd by Ga helps to alleviate the strong Pd–Pd antibonding interactions observed in Ga‐free Hf 7 Pd 10 .',\n",
       "   'Knowledge of structure–property relationships in solids with intrinsic low thermal conductivity is crucial for fields such as thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and refractories. Herein, we propose a new \"rigidness in softness\" structural scheme for intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity (κL), which embeds rigid clusters into the soft matrix to induce large lattice anharmonicity, and accordingly discover a new series of chalcogenides Pt3Bi4Q9 (Q = S, Se). Pt3Bi4S9–xSex (x = 3, 6) achieved an intrinsic ultralow κL down to 0.39 W/(m K) at 773 K, which is considerably low among the Bi chalcogenide thermoelectric materials. Pt3Bi4Q9 contains the rigid cubic [Pt6Q12]12– clusters embedded in the soft Bi-Q sublattice, involving multiple bonding interactions and vibration hierarchy. The hierarchical structure yields a large lattice anharmonicity with high Grüneisen parameters (γ) 1.97 of Pt3Bi4Q9, as verified by the effective scatter of low-lying optical phonons toward heat-carrying acoustic phonons. Consequently, the rigid-soft coupling significantly inhibits heat propagation, exhibiting low acoustic phonon frequencies (∼25 cm–1) and Debye temperatures (ΘD = 170.4 K) in Pt3Bi4Se9. Owing to the suppressed κL and considerable power factor (PF), the ZT value of Pt3Bi4S6Se3 can reach 0.56 at 773 K without heavy carrier doping, which is competitive among the pristine Bi chalcogenides. Theoretical calculations predicted a large potential for performance improvement via proper doping, indicating the great potential of this structure type for promising thermoelectric materials.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) have attracted much attention due to their low production cost and abundant resources. Germanium is a promising alloying‐type anode with a high theoretical capacity for PIBs, yet suffering significant volume expansion and sluggish potassium‐ion transport kinetics. Herein, a rational strategy is formulated to disperse Ge atoms into transition metal V−S sulfide frameworks to form a loosely packed and metallic GeV 4 S 8 medium. The theoretical prediction shows that GeV 4 S 8 is conducive to the adsorption and diffusion of K + . The V−S frameworks provide fast ion/electron diffusion channels and also help to buffer the volume expansion during K + insertion. In situ and ex situ characterizations manifest that KGe alloy clusters are constrained and dispersed by potassiated VS 2 topological structure during discharging, and revert to the original GeV 4 S 8 after charging. Consequently, as a novel anode for PIBs, GeV 4 S 8 provides a high specific capacity of ≈400 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C, maintaining 160 mAh g −1 even at 12.5 C and ≈80% capacity after 1000 cycles at 5 C, superior to most of the state‐of‐the‐art anode materials. The proposed strategy of combining alloy and intercalation dual‐functional units is expected to open up a new way for high‐capacity and high‐rate anode for PIBs.',\n",

       "   'Large and rapid lithium storage is hugely demanded for high-energy/power lithium-ion batteries; however, it is difficult to achieve these two indicators simultaneously. Sn-based materials with a (de)alloying mechanism show low working potential and high theoretical capacity, but the huge volume expansion and particle agglomeration of Sn restrict cyclic stability and rate capability. Herein, a soft-in-rigid concept was proposed and achieved by chemical scissoring where a soft Sn–S bond was chosen as chemical tailor to break the Ti–S bond to obtain a loose stacking structure of 1D chain-like Sn1.2Ti0.8S3. The in situ and ex situ (micro)structural characterizations demonstrate that the Sn–S bonds are reduced into Sn domains and such Sn disperses in the rigid Ti–S framework, thus relieving the volume expansion and particle agglomeration by chemical and physical shielding. Benefiting from the merits of large-capacity Sn with an alloying mechanism and high-rate TiS2 with an intercalation mechanism, the Sn1.2Ti0.8S3 anode offers a high specific capacity of 963.2 mA h g–1 at 0.1 A g–1 after 100 cycles and a reversible capacity of 250 mA h g–1 at 10 A g–1 after 3900 cycles. Such a strategy realized by chemical tailoring at the structural unit level would broaden the prospects for constructing joint high-capacity and high-rate LIB anodes.',\n",

       "   'Loss of ARID1A has been reported to drive the progression of lung adenocarcinoma, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we performed secretome analysis to identify the key secreted proteins regulating lung adenocarcinoma progression. We showed that the VASN level was significantly elevated in the conditioned medium from ARID1A-depleted A549 and H1299 cells. Restoration of ARID1A in ARID1A-depleted lung adenocarcinoma cells prevented the upregulation and secretion of VASN. Clinical analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between ARID1A and VASN expression in ARID1A-mutated lung adenocarcinomas. The patients with ARID1A-mutated lung adenocarcinoma had significantly higher concentrations of serum VASN than healthy controls. Moreover, serum VASN concentrations were associated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival of the patients with ARID1A-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. Functional studies indicated that VASN overexpression potentiated the proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Antibody neutralization of VASN suppressed the aggressiveness of ARID1A-depleted lung adenocarcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Addition of recombinant VASN protein promoted the proliferation and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Additionally, knockdown of Notch1 blocked the aggressive phenotype induced by recombinant VASN protein. In conclusion, our data uncover the role of VASN in mediating the progression of ARID1A-depleted lung adenocarcinoma and highlight VASN as a promising therapeutic target for this disease.'],\n",

The system studied is a promising multiferroic material of the 2$^{\\\\text {nd}}$ type, in which a strong coupling between the magnetic and electric systems can be related to the fact that the same Mn$^{4+}$ ions are responsible for the two orderings. Analysis of the anomaly at the magnetic transition was done by using the advanced theory of the continuous transitions, in which the presence of higher order terms in the free energy is considered, and the parameters of the critical behavior of the system were estimated. It was found that, despite of earlier predictions, the transition loses the continuous character and can become the 1$^{\\\\text {st}}$ order process for the Ti-containing samples. The anomalies accompanying the 1$^{\\\\text{st}}$ order high-temperature ferroelectric transition were found to be hardly visible by using both techniques, which was ascribed to a wide temperature range of coexistence of the dielectric and ferroelectric phases.'],\n",

Traditionally relying on a few algorithms like MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, there is a pressing need for enhanced portability across diverse computing platforms. In response, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO was expanded to support Nvidia GPUs using CUDA. This paper explores further advancements by porting MadGraph to SYCL, aiming to improve portability and leverage the heterogeneous architectures of modern supercomputers. Physics figures-of-merit are used to compare performance on Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs, and Intel GPUs and CPUs. A comprehensive performance comparison of MadGraph on Nvidia, AMD, and Intel GPUs, and Intel CPUs is presented, using physics figures-of-merit. This includes benchmarks against CUDA (on GPU) and OpenMP (on CPU) implementations, offering a holistic view of performance across different platforms. Weak scaling results on the Polaris (Nvidia GPUs) and Aurora (Intel GPUs) systems demonstrate that SYCL not only ensures portability but also maintains competitive performance. The adoption of SYCL achieves this without the complexities of managing multiple code bases or extensive use of preprocessor directives, presenting a promising approach for future developments in high-energy physics simulations.'],\n",

The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",

Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

       "   'This study investigated the effectiveness of a mobile-based writing tool (MBWT) on a group of middle school-aged Latinx English learners’ (ELs) narrative writing development in the Midwest United States. Implementing an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, 26 ELs completed five funds-of-knowledge-featured narrative writing essays in ten weeks operating under a switching replications quasi-experimental design. When controlling for the five writing topics, the results from mixed-effects multilevel modeling analysis revealed statistically significant and positive effects of the MBWT on the development of the ELs’ writing skills. The results also showed that the effect of the MBWT on writing performance was stronger for male students than for females. Findings of a follow-up qualitative research phase indicated that ELs had positive perceptions toward the adoption of the MBWT. Potential factors that influenced the integrated learning and gender effects were explored as well. This study is significant for engaging teachers in exploring the potential of designing and implementing inclusive mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) for diverse ethnic-minority student populations.',\n",
       "   'ABSTRACT Considering the pivotal role of creativity across various eras and the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in both creative processes and education, this study introduces and provides validity evidence for the AI‐assisted Creativity Questionnaire (AICQ). This new 16‐item instrument aims to quantify human creative potential in AI‐assisted endeavors. Initially, a diverse cohort of 322 university students in Taiwan completed the AICQ from November to December 2023. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of responses from this sample, three distinct factors emerged: (1) AI‐assisted functional creativity (AIFC), (2) AI‐assisted visual artistic creativity (AIVAC), and (3) AI‐assisted ideational creativity (AIIC). One item was removed due to cross‐loading. Subsequently, in September 2024, 330 university students in Taiwan engaged with both the AICQ and the 28‐item Creative Behavior Inventory (CBI). Based on responses from this sample, construct validity evidence for the AICQ was examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which affirmed that a three‐factor model provided a good fit to the data. Gender differences in AICQ scores were found in these subsequent data. Overall, data from participants provided evidence for the reliability as well as convergent, concurrent, and discriminant validity of the scores obtained from the AICQ.',\n",

Results showed that active learning had a direct effect on GLI, while critical thinking and group participation self-efficacy had indirect effects on GLI as mediated by active learning.

       "   \"We present a target field approach to analytically design magnetic fields using permanent magnets. We assume that their magnetisation is bound to a two-dimensional surface and is composed of a complete basis of surface modes. By posing the Poisson's equation relating the magnetic scalar potential to the magnetisation using Green's functions, we derive simple integrals which determine the magnetic field generated by each mode. This approach is demonstrated by deriving the governing integrals for optimising axial magnetisation on cylindrical and circular-planar surfaces. We approximate the governing integrals numerically and implement them into a regularised least-squares optimisation routine to design permanent magnets that generate uniform axial and transverse target magnetic fields. The resulting uniform axial magnetic field profiles demonstrate more than a tenfold increase in uniformity across equivalent target regions compared to the field generated by an optimally separated axially magnetised pair of rings, as validated using finite element method simulations. We use a simple example to examine how two-dimensional surface magnetisation profiles can be emulated using thin three-dimensional volumes and determine how many discrete intervals are required to accurately approximate a continuously-varying surface pattern. Magnets designed using our approach may enable higher quality bias fields for electric machines, nuclear fusion, fundamental physics, magnetic trapping, and beyond.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Background and Objectives Advancing automation technologies are replacing certain occupations such as those involving simple food preparation more than occupations such as those in STEM fields (e.g., engineering and health care). Older workers generally face higher job automation risks in part due to their lower levels of digital skills. A better understanding of the associations between job automation risk, digital skills, and type of occupation (e.g., STEM vs non-STEM) can facilitate preparations for job automation and workforce population aging. Research Design and Methods We analyzed a nationally representative sample (N = 1,560) of middle-aged and older U.S. workers aged 50–74 years from the 2012/2014/2017 Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) restricted-use file. The estimated job automation risks (i.e., percentage of jobs to be automated in the next decades) were derived from the previous studies. PIAAC digital problem-solving skills proficiency (measured on a scale of 0–500 points) was assessed based on a series of practical digital tasks (e.g., finding a job research website that does not require registration). Results Linear regression analysis showed that greater digital skill proficiency (b = −0.04, p &amp;lt; .05) and STEM occupations (b = −17.78, p &amp;lt; .001) each were associated with lower job automation risks, even after adjusting for a series of demographic, socioeconomic, and civic engagement characteristics.

       "   '&lt;p style=\"text-align:justify\"&gt;Research shows that learning enjoyment in specific socio-scientific issues (SSI) plays an important role in predicting grade 10 students’ learning interest and learning enjoyment (i.e., genuine interest) in SSI subjects generally. However, it remains unexplored whether learning enjoyment also mediates a predictive effect of learning interest in a Big Science SSI of pressing contemporary global concern—COVID-19—on grade 12 high school students’ learning interest in SSI generally. The purpose of this study is to investigate how learning enjoyment may mediate the predictive effect of learning interest in the specific Big Science SSI of COVID-19 specifically on students’ learning interest in SSI subjects generally. Latent variable modeling using data collected from grade 12 students (N = 691) showed personal perceptions of learning enjoyment in SSI partially mediated the predictive effect of learning interest in the SSI of COVID-19 on learning interest in other Big Science SSI subjects. Implications for promoting among science educators and policy specialists the active development of students’ individual interests and involvement in other 21st century Big Science SSI challenges are forwarded. &lt;/p&gt;',\n",
       "   \"Group cohesion is considered a key group therapeutic factor; however, limited knowledge exists on the session-to-session development of group cohesion in the context of training groups or on the factors that may predict such developments. We utilized multilevel growth modeling to examine the longitudinal changes in 44 counselor trainees' ratings of group cohesion in seven experiential growth groups across four semesters. We found significant between-person variability in the growth trajectory of group cohesion and identified trainee self-disclosure and gender as significant predictors of group cohesion. The results indicated the complexity of within- and between-person changes in group cohesion in training groups and the need for further research to identify potential predictors of these changes. We also discussed ways for group facilitators to attend to self-disclosure as an important marker of group cohesion.\",\n",
       "   \"ABSTRACT Previous research suggests that teachers' adoption of inquiry‐based teaching is influenced by school culture's openness to creative solutions, with teachers' self‐efficacy in inquiry‐based teaching acting as a mediator. However, considering the potential impact of local educational and socio‐cultural context on teachers' behavior, findings from one country may not readily generalize to another. For example, in regions with limited exposure and resources for inquiry‐based teaching, self‐efficacy may play a more prominent mediating role. Therefore, examining the comparative relationship between school culture's openness to creative solutions and teaching practices in Asian and European countries is worthwhile. This multinational study employed data from 23 Asian and European countries to scrutinize the connection between school culture's openness to creative solutions and inquiry‐based teaching, with teachers' self‐efficacy in inquiry‐based teaching as the mediating factor. The results extended the findings of a previous single‐country investigation and provided evidence supporting an indirect effect of school culture's openness to creative solutions on inquiry‐based teaching as mediated by teacher self‐efficacy across all 23 countries. Furthermore, it revealed stronger effects in Asian countries compared to their European counterparts.\",\n",
       "   \"Considering the digitalisation of the workplace and increasingly crucial digital skill proficiency in the technology-rich labour market, the objectives of the present study are to develop digital skill use profiles and to identify specific individual characteristics that are linked with digital skill use patterns among older workers in the United States. However, relatively little is known about older workers' digital skill use patterns and skill use opportunity structures. Data of the U.S. older workers (age 50 years and older; n = 1,670) were obtained from the 2012/2014/2017 International Assessment of the Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Latent class analysis – a form of person-centred approach that identifies subgroups based on distinctive digital skill use patterns, showed that there were two underlying subgroups of older workers, including more frequent and less frequent digital skill users. More frequent users practiced a greater variety of digital skills both at work and outside of work than their counterparts. Also, logistic regression analysis showed that higher digital skill proficiency and full-time employment (vs. part-time) were associated with belonging to the more frequent digital skill use subgroup. The digital skill use profiles of U.S. older workers, subgroup characteristics, and implications for adult education and labour policies are evaluated.\"],\n",

       "   'Abstract High‐temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT‐PEMFCs) demonstrate crude hydrogen can be a cost‐effective fuel source. However, the performance of HT‐PEMFCs is hindered by challenges such as high‐concentration CO poisoning and preferential adsorption of H 3 PO 4 on electrocatalysts. This study explores the performance of Pt group metals as anode catalysts, specifically focusing on hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity, H 3 PO 4 tolerance, and CO tolerance under operational conditions in HT‐PEMFCs. The results reveal that all Pt‐group catalysts significantly improve HOR activity with increasing reaction temperature. Notably, Pd‐based catalysts demonstrate superior H 3 PO 4 tolerance and CO tolerance. HT‐PEMFCs using Pd/C as the anode catalyst maintain the highest output power density, achieving a remarkable 6.4‐fold performance compared to Pt/C catalysts and superior stability in the presence of 3%–10% CO in H 2 . Both experimental and theoretical investigations have consistently demonstrated that Pd possesses the weakest CO adsorption energy, the existence of CO in crude H 2 in HT‐PEMFCs inhibits hydrogen overflow from the lattice interstitial space of Pd, and the trapped lattice hydrogen further promotes the desorption of CO. This research contributes to the advancement of direct utilizing industrial crude hydrogen as a fuel for HT‐PEMFCs and offers invaluable insights into reactions involving CO.',\n",

       "   'Surface oxygen vacancies in the catalysts play a key role in improving the catalytic performances for low-temperature oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). Herein, macroporous La2Ce2–xCaxO7−δ (A2B2O7-type) catalysts with a disordered defective cubic fluorite phased structure were prepared by a citric acid sol–gel method. The macroporous structure improved the accessibility of the reactants (O2 and CH4) to the active sites. The partial substitution of the B site (Ce) with low-valence calcium (Ca) ions in La2Ce2–xCaxO7−δ catalysts induced the formation of surface oxygen vacancies, which facilitated the adsorption and activation of O2 molecules to generate the active oxygen species (O2– species). The O2– species can boost the activation of CH4 and govern the following step of the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. La2Ce2–xCaxO7−δ catalysts have high catalytic activity for low-temperature OCM, and the La2Ce1.3Ca0.7O7−δ catalyst with the highest density of O2– species exhibits the highest catalytic activity during low-temperature OCM into C2H4 and C2H6 (C2) products, i.e., its CH4 conversion, selectivity, and yield of C2 products at 600 °C are 31.0, 65.6, and 20.3%, respectively. Based on the results of multiple experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the mechanism of La2Ce2–xCaxO7−δ catalysts for the OCM reaction is proposed: surface oxygen vacancies induced by the substitution of the Ce site with Ca ions significantly promote the critical steps of C–H bond breaking and C–C bond coupling during the low-temperature OCM reaction. It is important for the design of low-temperature and high-efficiency catalysts for practical applications.',\n",

       "   'Abstract Methanol oxidation plays a central role to implement sustainable energy economy, which is restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics due to the multi‐electron transfer process accompanied by numerous sequential intermediate. In this study, an efficient cascade methanol oxidation reaction is catalyzed by single‐Ir‐atom catalyst at ultra‐low potential (&lt;0.1 V) with the promotion of the thermal and electrochemical integration in a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. At the elevated temperature, the electron deficient Ir site with higher methanol affinity could spontaneous catalyze the CH 3 OH dehydrogenation to CO under the voltage, then the generated CO and H 2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO 2 and proton. However, the methanol cannot thermally decompose with the voltage absence, which confirm the indispensable of the coupling of thermal and electrochemical integration for the methanol oxidation. By assembling the methanol oxidation reaction with hydrogen evolution reaction with single‐Ir‐atom catalysts in the anode chamber, a max hydrogen production rate reaches 18 mol g Ir −1 h −1 , which is much greater than that of Ir nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C. This study also demonstrated the electrochemical methanol oxidation activity of the single atom catalysts, which broadens the renewable energy devices and the catalyst design by an integration concept.',\n",
       "   'Hydrogen production from methanol represents an energy-sustainable way to produce ethanol, but it normally results in heavy CO2 emissions. The selective conversion of methanol into H2 and valuable chemical feedstocks offers a promising strategy; however, it is limited by the harsh operating conditions and low conversion efficiency. Herein, we realize efficient high-purity H2 and CO production from methanol by coupling the thermocatalytic methanol dehydrogenation with electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation on a bifunctional Ru/C catalyst. Electrocatalysis enables the acceleration of C–H cleavage and reduces the partial pressure of hydrogen at the anode, which drives the chemical equilibrium and significantly enhances methanol dehydrogenation. Furthermore, a bilayer Ru/C + Pd/C electrode is designed to mitigate CO poisoning and facilitate hydrogen oxidation. As a result, a high yield of H2 (558.54 mmol h–1 g–1) with high purity (99.9%) was achieved by integrating an applied cell voltage of 0.4 V at 200 °C, superior to the conventional thermal and electrocatalytic processes, and CO is the main product at the anode.

       "   'The lattice structure is known to influence interfacial reactivities of nanoscale alloy catalysts, but little is known about how the lattice strain can be sustainably controlled by the nanoscale morphology under electrocatalytic reaction conditions. Herein, a previously unknown self-regulated stability of lattice strains is demonstrated by engineering highly active platinum–copper alloy nanowires with two distinctive types of morphology. The dendritic alloy nanowires exhibit the best performance for oxygen reduction reaction among the reported platinum–copper alloy catalysts. In comparison with the initial difference of compressive lattice strains between smooth and dendritic nanowires, the strains are shown to be controllable, which coincides with the highly durable electrocatalytic performance throughout the duration of oxygen reduction reaction despite the occurrence of dealloying. By thorough characterizations of the nanowire morphologies, compositions, and lattice strains, the self-regulated stability of lattice strains is revealed to originate from the operation of a combination of morphology-tuned compressive strain and realloying in the dendritic nanowires for the enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability. These findings have significant implications for the design of high-durability alloy catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis.',\n",

       "   'The transportation of coal-based solid waste filling slurry (CSWFS) through pipelines for underground goaf injection is essential for enhancing mine safety and promoting green, low-carbon coal mining. To address the issue of pipeline blockage caused by the suspension sensitivity of CSWFS during long-distance transportation, this study proposes the addition of the suspending agent hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) to transform the filling slurry into a stable suspending slurry. The mechanism by which the suspending agent modifies the rheological property of CSWFS was elucidated and verified. Firstly, an evaluation index system for the suspending state of CSWFS based on the “experimental test and theoretical calculation” was established. The values for layering degree, bleeding rate time-loss, and the corresponding average time-loss rate over 0 to 120 min of A1–A5 CSWFS were recorded as 24 mm–2 mm, 3.0–0.2%, 252.4–54.2%, and 149.6–14.6%, respectively. The concentration gradient evaluation result, C/CA = 0.91 (≥0.8), confirmed that the suspending agent maintained a stable suspending state over time for CSWFS. Secondly, it was demonstrated that the suspending agent HPMC modified the rheological property of A1–A5 CSWFS by increasing its plastic viscosity, which strengthened the viscous resistance to particle settling, thereby transforming a semi-stable slurry into a stable one. Additionally, the formation of a spatial suspending network by the suspending agent ensures that no pipeline blockage accidents occured in practical engineering applications. Furthermore, the XRD and SEM tests were utilized to verify the microstructure of the top (T) and bottom (B) samples in A4 block. It was concluded that the type of hydration products, occurrence forms, lapping compactness, and microstructural development were consistent, ultimately forming a high-strength, dense, hardened filling block. Finally, numerical simulation confirmed that the addition of suspending agent in A4 slurry formed a comprehensive spatial suspending network and a well-structured, unified system. This is one effective approach which could contribute to addressing the technical issue of pipeline blockage during long-distance pipeline transportation.',\n",

Inspired by the error analysis of GANs, we find that statistical errors mainly arise from random sampling, leading to significant uncertainties in GANs. To address this issue, we propose a selective sampling mechanism called space‐filling sampling. Our method aims to increase the sampling probability in areas with insufficient data, thereby improving the learning performance of the generator. Theoretical analysis confirms the effectiveness of our approach in reducing statistical errors and accelerating convergence in GANs. This research represents a pioneering effort in targeting the reduction of statistical errors in GANs, and it demonstrates the potential for enhancing the training of other generative models.',\n",
       "   'In this study, the impact of codoping Mg and Ti on the thermoelectric performance of AgSbTe2 materials was investigated. Through a two-step synthesis process involving slow cooling and spark plasma sintering, AgSb0.98–xMg0.02TixTe2 samples were prepared. The introduction of Mg and Ti dopants effectively suppressed the formation of the undesirable Ag2Te phase. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that Ti doping facilitated the band convergence, leading to a reduction in the effective mass of the carriers. This optimization enhanced carrier mobility and, consequently, electrical conductivity. Additionally, the codoping strategy resulted in the reinforcement of point defects, which contributed to a decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. The AgSb0.98–xMg0.02TixTe2 sample achieved a maximum figure of merit (ZT) value of 1.45 at 523 K, representing an 87% improvement over the undoped AgSbTe2 sample. The average ZT value over the temperature range of 323–573 K was 1.09, marking a significant enhancement in thermoelectric performance. This research demonstrates the potential of Mg and Ti codoping as a strategy to improve the thermoelectric properties of AgSbTe2-based materials.',\n",

The role of oilfield chemicals in the process of oil and gas exploration, development, and production is becoming more and more important, and the demand is rising year by year. The support of national policies and the formulation of environmental protection regulations have put forward higher requirements for oilfield chemical products, which has promoted the innovative research and development and market application of oilfield chemicals. Polyformaldehyde glycol ether polymer (PGEP) is simple to synthesize, easily biodegradable, green and environmentally friendly, and in line with the development trend of chemicals used in oil and gas development. The interfacial tension performance of PGEP after compounding with different surfactants can reach as low as 0.00034 mN/m, which meets the requirements of the oilfield (interfacial tension ≤ 5 × 10−3 mN/m). The best oil washing efficiency performance of PGEP compounded with different surfactants reached 78.2%, which meets the requirements of the oilfield (oil washing efficiency ≥ 40%). The fracturing fluid drainage efficiency of PGEP after compounding with different surfactants reaches 22%, which meets the requirements of the oilfield (drainage efficiency ≥ 15%). The surface interfacial tension of the system remains constant after the concentration exceeds 0.2% and decreases with lower concentrations. The drainage efficiency increases with increasing concentrations in the range below 0.6%.

       "   'A novel zero-reference low-light image-enhancement approach based on noise estimation (ZLEN) is proposed to mitigate noise interference in image-enhancement processes, while the tenets of zero-reference and lightweight network architecture are maintained. ZLEN improves the high-order curve expression governing the mapping of low-light images to their enhanced counterparts, addressing image noise through a meticulously designed noise-estimation module and a zero-reference noise loss function. First, the higher-order curve expression with a noise term is defined, and then the noise map undergoes feature extraction through the semantic-aware attention module; following this, the resulting features are integrated with the low-light image. Ultimately, a lightweight convolutional neural network is adjusted to estimate higher-order curve parameters that link the low-light image to its enhanced version. Notably, ZLEN achieves luminance enhancement and noise reduction without paired or unpaired training data. Rigorous qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted on diverse benchmark datasets, demonstrating that ZLEN attained state-of-the-art (SOAT) status among existing zero-reference and unpaired-reference image-enhancement methodologies, while it exhibited comparable performance to full-reference image-enhancement methods. To confirm the practicality and robustness of ZLEN, the luminance enhancement was applied to mine images, which yielded satisfactory results.',\n",

       "   'Abstract The behavior of fractal growth based on copper metal was examined by micro‐point electrode electrodeposition. On this basis, the process and morphological characteristic of Cu fractal growth can be controlled by changing the electrodeposition time, current and concentration of Cu 2+ . The growth of snowflake Cu dendrites is confined to the two‐dimensional plane of the paper base to monitor the fractal structural changes. The electrodeposition process of snowflake Cu dendrites is deeply regulated by exploring the changing trend of fractal dimension. To further understand the fractal growth mechanism of Cu, the electro‐driven centripetal migration and random migration of ions are introduced in the traditional diffusion‐limited aggregation model. The simulated fractal patterns successfully correspond with the experimental results. The results are helpful to explore the fractal growth characteristics and dynamic mechanism of the electrodeposited copper dendrites, which lay a foundation for controlling the growth of the electrodeposited metal dendrites.',\n",
       "   'Organic emitters with both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have attracted widespread interest for their intriguing luminescent properties. Herein, a series of triphenylamine-substituted isoquinoline derivatives possessing monomeric TADF and aggregated RTP properties are reported. As the molecules exhibited various forms of π-π and charge transfer (CT) stacking with different intensities, inter/intramolecular CT can be meticulously modulated to achieve tunable TADF-RTP. Aggregated phosphorescence originates from intermolecular CT initiated by CT dimers, whereas monomeric TADF is facilitated by intramolecular CT enhanced by π-π dimers. Leveraging the properties of these molecules, luminescent materials with tunable TADF-RTP properties in multistates are obtained by molecular substitution position alignment, dealing with different solvents, grinding, adjusting concentration, changing polymer matrix, photoactivation, and heat treatment. This work is critical for a deeper understanding of construction and regulation of the TADF-RTP dual-channel emission, enabling the development of advanced optoelectronic devices with tailored emission properties.',\n",

       "   'Abstract Hydrogen energy from electrocatalysis driven by sustainable energy has emerged as a solution against the background of carbon neutrality. Proton exchange membrane (PEM)‐based electrocatalytic systems represent a promising technology for hydrogen production, which is equipped to combine efficiently with intermittent electricity from renewable energy sources. In this review, PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems for H 2 production are summarized systematically from low to high operating temperature systems. When the operating temperature is below 130°C, the representative device is a PEM water electrolyzer; its core components and respective functions, research status, and design strategies of key materials especially in electrocatalysts are presented and discussed. However, strong acidity, highly oxidative operating conditions, and the sluggish kinetics of the anode reaction of PEM water electrolyzers have limited their further development and shifted our attention to higher operating temperature PEM systems. Increasing the temperature of PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems can cause an increase in current density, accelerate reaction kinetics and gas transport and reduce the ohmic value, activation losses, Δ G H* , and power consumption. Moreover, further increasing the operating temperature (120–300°C) of PEM‐based devices endows various hydrogen carriers (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and ammonia) with electrolysis, offering a new opportunity to produce hydrogen using PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems. Finally, several future directions and prospects for developing PEM‐based electrocatalytic systems for H 2 production are proposed through devoting more efforts to the key components of devices and reduction of costs.',\n",

Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetics of metal catalysts for the CHZ oxidation reaction (CHZOR) has hinder the wide application of the fuel. In the present work, transition metal single atom catalyst (MSA, M=Fe, Co and Ni) supported palladium nanoparticles (NPs) have been studied for the CHZOR. Distinct from the conventional active carbon supports, the MSA nanotubes play a bifunctional role by acting as the catalyst support and tuning the electronic structure of Pd NPs and simultaneously increasing the activity of Pd for CHZOR. Among them, Pd/FeSA shows the fast kinetics for CHZOR in terms of mass activity, specific activity and electron transfer number (Figure 1A). That is due to the stronger electron donation of Fe atoms to the Pd nanoparticles than other samples. Furthermore, density functional theory calculation and significantly emission of gases including CO 2 and N 2 in CHZOR from differential electrochemical mass spectrometer confirm that reaction mainly goes through the dehydrogenation of N-H bond and then cleavage of C-N bond with formation of N 2 and CO ads at low potential and subsequent CO 2 emission at high potential, while small amount of *N 2 H 3 species undergo N-N bond cleavage accompanied with trace amount of NH 3 emission (Figure 1B).

In this study, an MKPC coating paste satisfying the design specifications of self-compacting concrete was prepared by increasing the water-cement (W/C) ratio and adding Na 2 SiO 3 and silica micropowder (SMP) to regulate the fluidity and compatibility. The mechanical strength, deformation, water absorption, and long-term water stability were compared for MKPC coating pastes with and without SMP. Replacing MgO powder with 10% SMP could improve the physical and mechanical properties of MKPC paste under long-term water immersion. After 540 d of water immersion, the flexural and compressive strength residuals of the reference MKPC without SMP (0SMP10M) were 84.4% and 74.6%, respectively. In contrast, those of the MKPC with 10% SMP (1SMP9M) were 105.6% and 97.9%, respectively. The volume of 0SMP10M expanded during 540 d of water immersion, and the final volume deformation was 10.1 × 10 −4 , while the volume expansion of 1SMP9M was 7.46 × 10 −4 .

Modulating the Li‐ion solvation structures is pivotal in forming a stable SEI for stabilizing Li metal anodes. Here a strategy is developed to fine‐tune the Li‐ion solvation structures through enhanced dipole–dipole interactions between the Li‐ion‐coordinated solvent and the non‐Li‐ion‐coordinating diluent, for creating a stable SEI in the developed binary salt electrolyte. The enhanced dipole–dipole interactions weaken the coordination between Li‐ions and the solvents while strengthening the interaction between Li‐ions and dual anions, thereby facilitating the Li‐ion transport and a robust anion‐derived SEI with a distinct bilayer structure.

       "   'Efficiently regulating the rebound behavior of droplets post-impact is crucial for various fields, mainly including the development of self-cleaning applications, the design of surface functional materials, and the advancement of industrial techniques. By performing molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the impact and jumping behavior of droplets on heterogeneous substrates with different wetting regions. We found that, during the impacting evolution process, the retracted droplets would move toward regions with stronger wettability due to the unbalanced force caused by the wettability difference, revealing the directional migration ability. The values of the wettability difference strongly affect the degree of oblique rebound and contact time when droplets can jump off the substrate. We then designed the surfaces with a wettability gradient and found that the oblique rebound angle could be well controlled and the contact time further reduced. Our findings may provide valuable insight into the relationship between the wettability gradient and the behavior of liquid droplets on surfaces, with broad implications for various fields such as surface engineering, materials science, microfluidics, etc.',\n",

       "   'Redox-active molecules, or redoxmers, in nonaqueous redox flow batteries often suffer from membrane crossover and low electrochemical stability. Transforming inorganic polyionic redoxmers established for aqueous batteries into nonaqueous candidates is an attractive strategy to address these challenges. Here we demonstrate such tailoring for hexacyanoferrate (HCF) by pairing the anions with tetra-n-butylammonium cation (TBA+). TBA3HCF has good solubility in acetonitrile and >1 V lower redox potential vs the aqueous counterpart; thus, the familiar aqueous catholyte becomes a new nonaqueous anolyte. The lowering of redox potential correlates with replacement of water by acetonitrile in the solvation shell of HCF, which can be traced to H-bond formation between water and cyanide ligands. Symmetric flow cells indicate exceptional stability of HCF polyanions in nonaqueous electrolytes and Nafion membranes completely block HCF crossover in full cells. Ion pairing of metal complexes with organic counterions can be effective for developing promising redoxmers for nonaqueous flow batteries.',\n",

However, they cannot be used to evaluate the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The first generation of virus‐like particle (VLP) pseudotyped viruses contains these four structural proteins, but their titers for wild‐type severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) are relatively low, even lower for the omicron variant, rendering them unsuitable for neutralizing antibody detection. By optimizing the spike glycoprotein signal peptide, substituting the complexed M and E proteins with SARS‐COV‐1, optimizing the N protein with specific mutations (P199L, S202R, and R203M), and truncating the packaging signal, PS9, we increased the titer of the wild‐type VLP pseudotyped virus over 100‐fold, and successfully packaged the omicron VLP pseudotyped virus. The SARS‐CoV‐2 VLP pseudotyped viruses maintained stable titers, even through 10 freeze–thaw cycles. The key neutralization assay parameters were optimized, including cell type, cell number, and viral inoculum. The assay demonstrated minimal variation in both intra‐ and interassay results, at 11.5% and 11.1%, respectively. The correlation between the VLP pseudotyped virus and the authentic virus was strong ( r = 0.9). Suitable for high‐throughput detection of various mutant strains in clinical serum.

       "   'Vision Transformers (ViTs) have exhibited exceptional performance across diverse computer vision tasks, while their substantial parameter size incurs significantly increased memory and computational demands, impeding effective inference on resource-constrained devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these challenges, yet existing methods still suffer from significant accuracy loss at low-bit. We attribute this issue to the distinctive distributions of post-LayerNorm and post-GELU activations within ViTs, rendering conventional hardware-friendly quantizers ineffective, particularly in low-bit scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Activation-Distribution-Friendly post-training Quantization for Vision Transformers, ADFQ-ViT. Concretely, we introduce the Per-Patch Outlier-aware Quantizer to tackle irregular outliers in post-LayerNorm activations. This quantizer refines the granularity of the uniform quantizer to a per-patch level while retaining a minimal subset of values exceeding a threshold at full-precision. To handle the non-uniform distributions of post-GELU activations between positive and negative regions, we design the Shift-Log2 Quantizer, which shifts all elements to the positive region and then applies log2 quantization. Moreover, we present the Attention-score enhanced Module-wise Optimization which adjusts the parameters of each quantizer by reconstructing errors to further mitigate quantization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate ADFQ-ViT provides significant improvements over various baselines in image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks at 4-bit. Specifically, when quantizing the ViT-B model to 4-bit, we achieve a 10.23% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.',\n",

However, the diversity of downstream tasks and practical requirements makes deploying multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models challenging. Current methods that compress the delta weight struggle to achieve ultra-high compression, failing to minimize the deployment overhead. To address the above issue, we propose a novel distribution-driven delta compression framework DeltaDQ, which utilizes Group-wise Dropout and Separate Quantization to achieve ultra-high compression for the delta weight. We have observed that the matrix-computed intermediate results for the delta weight exhibit extremely small variance and min-max range characteristics, referred to as Balanced Intermediate Results. Exploiting this phenomenon, we introduce Group-wise Dropout to perform dropout on the delta weight using an optimal group size. Furthermore, using Separate Quantization, sparse weights are quantized and decomposed to achieve a lower bit. Experimental results show that DeltaDQ achieves 16x compression with improved accuracy compared to baselines for WizardMath and WizardCoder models across different parameter scales. Moreover, DeltaDQ demonstrates the ability for ultra-high compression ratio, achieving 128x compression for the WizardMath-7B model and 512x compression for the WizardMath-70B model.',\n",

However, the relationship among wettability, coalescence mode, and substrate characteristics (roughness and nanopillar height) remains unclear. In this work, two coalescence modes, climbing coalescence and contacting coalescence, are first observed in the dynamic behaviors of Ti and Al droplets on rough substrates. Due to the nonsynchronized wetting state transition of the droplets, the coalescence mode with increasing substrate characteristics differs, transitioning from contacting coalescence to climbing coalescence and then returning to the contacting mode. In general, the mode of coalescence correlates closely with the respective wetting states. Typically, Ti and Al droplets coalesce in the contacting mode when they have the same wetting state, but if they have different wetting states, they coalesce in the climbing mode.

The five categories of polarizations (parapolar, electropolar, magnetopolar, antimagnetopolar, and multipolar) expand the familiar notion of electric dipolarization in ferroelectrics and magnetization in ferromagnets to higher-order multipole densities. The five categories of chirality (parachiral, electrochiral, magnetochiral, antimagnetochiral, and multichiral) expand the familiar notion of enantiomorphism due to non-superposable mirror images to the inversion symmetries $i$, $\\\\theta$, and $i\\\\theta$. In multichiral systems, all these inversion symmetries are absent so that these systems have four distinct enantiomorphs. Each category of chirality arises from distinct superpositions of electric and magnetic multipole densities. We provide a complete theory of minimal effective models characterizing the different categories of chirality in different systems. Jointly these two schemes yield a classification of all 122 magnetic crystallographic point groups into 15 types that treat the inversion symmetries $i$, $\\\\theta$, and $i\\\\theta$ on the same footing. The group types are characterized via distinct physical properties and characteristic features in the electronic band structure. At the same time, the formal similarities between the inversion symmetries $i$, $\\\\theta$, and $i\\\\theta$ imply striking correspondences between apparently dissimilar systems and their physical properties.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract While basaltic volcanism is dominant during rifting and continental breakup, felsic magmatism may be a significant component of some rift margins. During International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 396 on the continental margin of Norway, a graphite‐garnet‐cordierite bearing dacitic unit (the Mimir dacite) was recovered in two holes within early Eocene sediments on Mimir High (Site U1570), a marginal high on the Vøring Transform Margin. Here, we present a comprehensive textural, petrological, and geochemical study of the Mimir dacite in order to assess its origin and discuss the geodynamic implications. The major mineral phases (garnet, cordierite, quartz, plagioclase, alkali feldspar) are hosted in a fresh rhyolitic, vesicular, glassy matrix that is locally mingled with sediments. The major element chemistry of garnet and cordierite, the presence of zircon inclusions with inherited cores, and thermobarometric calculations all support an upper crustal metapelitic origin. While most magma‐rich margin models favor crustal anatexis in the lower crust, thermobarometric calculations performed here show that the Mimir dacite was produced at upper‐crustal depths (&lt;5 kbar, 18 km depth) and high temperature (750–800°C) with up to 3 wt% water content. In situ U‐Pb analyses on zircon inclusions give a magmatic crystallization age of 54.6 ± 1.1 Ma, consistent with emplacement that post‐dates the Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum. Our results suggest that the opening of the Northeast Atlantic was associated with a phase of low‐pressure, high‐temperature crustal anatexis preceding the main phase of magmatism.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract. With the onset of anthropogenic climate change, it is vital that we understand climate sensitivity and rates of change during periods of warming in the Earth's past to properly inform climate forecasts. To best inform modeling of ongoing and future changes, environmental conditions during past periods of extreme warmth are ideally developed from multiproxy approaches, including the development of novel proxies where traditional approaches fail. This study builds on a proposed sea surface temperature (SST) proxy for the high-latitude Southern Ocean, based on the morphometrics of the ubiquitous Antarctic diatom Fragilariopsis kerguelensis. This species has been shown to display two distinct morphotypes; a low-rectangularity morphotype is interpreted to be more common in warmer waters while a high-rectangularity morphotype is more common in cooler waters. The proportion of the low-rectangularity morphotype (pLR) has been correlated to SST and summer SST (SSST). Here, we examine this proxy by reconstructing SST using sediment samples from the modern seafloor surface in the Amundsen Sea and the Sabrina Coast to test how well two published calibrations of this relationship (Kloster et al., 2018; Glemser et al., 2019) reconstruct SST and SSST in the modern ocean. In the Amundsen Sea surface sediments, we calculate derived SST −1.6 to −1.2 °C and derived SSST 0.6 to 0.7 °C. In the Sabrina Coast surface sediments, we calculate derived SST −0.3 to 0.5 °C and derived SSST 1.4 to 2.5 °C. We discuss the differing population dynamics of F. kerguelensis in our surface samples between the Amundsen Sea and Sabrina Coast because the Amundsen Sea specimens display a lower pLR than Sabrina Coast specimens, although they exist in warmer waters and should display a higher pLR. We also use the two published calibrations to preliminarily reconstruct SST and SSST in the Amundsen Sea over the last interglacial, Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS-5). We calculate SSTs that are slightly cooler or within the range of the modern Amundsen Sea for the duration of the last interglacial; we calculate summer SSTs ∼ 1 °C warmer than the modern Amundsen Sea. This suggests MIS-5 SSTs were at most marginally warmer than the modern Amundsen Sea.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract. In 1977–1978 and 1978–1979, the Ross Ice Shelf Project (RISP) recovered sediments from beneath the largest ice shelf in Antarctica at Site J-9 (∼82° S, 168° W), ∼450 km from open marine waters at the calving front of the Ross Ice Shelf and 890 km from the South Pole, one of the southernmost sites for marine sediment recovery in Antarctica. One important finding was the discovery of an active macrofauna, including crustaceans and fish, sustained below the ice shelf far from open waters. The sediment has a thin, unconsolidated upper unit (up to 20 cm thick) and a texturally similar but compacted lower unit (&gt;1 m thick) containing reworked early, middle, and late Miocene diatom and calcareous benthic foraminiferal assemblages. A probable post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) disconformity separates the upper unit containing a dominantly agglutinated foraminiferal assemblage, from the lower unit consisting mostly of reworked Miocene calcareous benthic species, including Trifarina fluens, Elphidium magellanicum, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Gyroidina sp., and Nonionella spp. The presence of the polar planktic foraminiferal species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and the endemic Antarcticella antarctica supports the late Miocene diatom age for the matrix of the lower unit. The microfossil assemblages indicate periods of ice sheet collapse and open-water conditions south of Site J-9 during warm intervals of the early, middle, and late Miocene, including the Miocene Climatic Optimum (∼17–14.7 Ma), demonstrating the dynamic nature of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Ross Ice Shelf during the Neogene. The foraminiferal assemblage of the upper unit is unique to the Ross Sea and suggests the influence of a sub-ice-shelf water mass proximal to the retreating post-LGM grounding zone. This unique assemblage is strongly dominated by the bathyal, cold-water agglutinated genus Cyclammina.',\n",
       "   'Abstract. Iceberg influence on diatom productivity has been observed for the present and suggested for the past, but direct seeding of the Southern Ocean during times of ice sheet collapse has never been directly demonstrated. Here we demonstrate enhanced diatom production and accumulation in the Amundsen Sea during a Mid-Pliocene interglacial that precisely coincides with pulses of ice-rafted debris (IRD) accumulation, and we infer a causal relation. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 379 obtained continuous sediment records from the Amundsen Sea continental rise to document West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) history in an area currently experiencing the largest ice loss in Antarctica. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imagery of Mid-Pliocene interglacial sediments of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) (GI-17, ∼ 3.9 Ma) documents distinct intervals of IRD-rich diatomite, whereas the overall diatom abundance and concentration of bloom species is relatively low in the absence of visible IRD. Sand- and granule-sized IRD grains are documented fully encased within diatomite laminae, with some displaying soft-sediment micro-deformation formed by grains falling into soft diatom ooze. IRD-rich diatomite layers are often characterized by nearly monospecific assemblages of the pelagic diatom Thalassiothrix antarctica, indicating very high primary productivity as IRD grains fell. Diatom-filled fecal pellets with clusters of barite grains are also documented within some of these laminae, further indicating direct mass sinking of diatom mats. Melting icebergs release soluble nutrients along with IRD; thus the coincidence of IRD and bloom species in Amundsen Sea sediments provides compelling evidence that iceberg discharge and melting directly initiates enhanced diatom productivity in the Southern Ocean. These results may contribute to interpreting past WAIS history by providing another proxy for potential collapse events. Furthermore, we suggest that ice sheet collapse may more broadly enhance Southern Ocean diatom production, which in itself can contribute to increased carbon export, potentially attenuating or countering the warming that may have triggered the collapse.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The use of occupational exoskeletons has grown fast in manufacturing industries in recent years. One major scenario of exoskeleton use in manufacturing is to assist overhead, power hand tool operations. This preliminary work aimed to determine the effects of arm-supporting exoskeletons on shoulder muscle activity and human-hand tool coupling in simulated overhead tasks with axially applied vibration. An electromagnetic shaker capable of producing the random vibration spectrum specified in ISO 10819 was hung overhead to deliver vibrations. Two passive, arm-supporting exoskeletons, with one (ExoVest) transferring load to both the shoulder and pelvic region while the second one (ExoStrap) transferring load primarily to the pelvic region, were used in testing. Testing was also done with the shaker placed in front of the body to better understand the posture and exoskeleton engagement effects. The results collected from 6 healthy male subjects demonstrate the dominating effects of the overhead working posture on increased shoulder muscle activities. Vibration led to higher muscle activities in both agonist and antagonist shoulder muscles to a less extent. Exoskeleton use reduced the anterior deltoid and serratus anterior activities by 27% to 43%. However, wearing the ExoStrap increased the upper trapezius activities by 23% to 38% in the overhead posture. Furthermore, an increased human-shaker handle coupling was observed in the OH posture when wearing the ExoVest, indicating a more demanding neuromuscular control.'],\n",

       "   'We present a detailed study of the local atomic and magnetic structure of the type-I multiferroic perovskite system $(\\\\mathrm{Sr},\\\\mathrm{Ba})(\\\\mathrm{Mn},\\\\mathrm{Ti}){\\\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ using x-ray and neutron pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, polarized neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation ($\\\\ensuremath{\\\\mu}\\\\mathrm{SR}$) techniques. The atomic PDF analysis reveals widespread nanoscale tetragonal distortions of the crystal structure even in the paraelectric phase with average cubic symmetry, corresponding to incipient ferroelectricity in the local structure. Magnetic PDF analysis, polarized neutron scattering, and $\\\\ensuremath{\\\\mu}\\\\mathrm{SR}$ likewise confirm the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state, which grow in magnitude as the temperature approaches the magnetic transition. We show that these short-range magnetic correlations coincide with a reduction of the tetragonal (i.e., ferroelectric) distortion in the average structure, suggesting that short-range magnetism can play an important role in magnetoelectric and/or magnetostructural phenomena even without genuine long-range magnetic order. The reduction of the tetragonal distortion scales linearly with the local magnetic order parameter, pointing to spontaneous linear magnetoelectric coupling in this system. These findings provide greater insight into the multiferroic properties of $(\\\\mathrm{Sr},\\\\mathrm{Ba})(\\\\mathrm{Mn},\\\\mathrm{Ti}){\\\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ and demonstrate the importance of investigating the local atomic and magnetic structure to gain a deeper understanding of the intertwined degrees of freedom in multiferroics.',\n",
       "   'We have conducted a comprehensive investigation into the magnetic properties of the chiral multiferroic material CoTeMoO6. In contrast with the previous claim of canted antiferromagnetic order with ferromagnetic components, our investigation reveals an antiferromagnetic ground state with compensated moments, providing an interesting platform for exploring exotic material properties. Through careful measurements of magnetization under a series of applied field, we demonstrate that there exist two sequential field-induced magnetic transitions in CoTeMoO6, with one occurring at $H_{c1}$=460 Oe along the a-axis, and the other at $H_{c2}$=1.16 T with the field along the b-axis. The values of H_c1 and H_c2 exhibit strong angular dependence and diverge with different rates as the applied field is rotated 90 degrees within the ab plane. This reflects the distinct nature of these transitions, which is further supported by the different critical behavior of $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$, characterized by the values of $\\\\gamma$,in the function of $H_c=H_0\\\\times(1-\\\\frac{T}{T_c})^n$. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that there exist structural and magnetic twin domains in CoTeMoO6 that strongly affect the experimental measurement of their macroscopic properties. Intriguingly, these twin domains can be related to the orthorhombicity/chirality of the crystal structure with the space group $P2_1 2_1 2$. We further explored the magnetic and structural domains with uniaxial pressure and polarized light microscopy. Our results suggest that CoTeMoO6 could be used as a unique platform for investigating the intriguing physics involving intertwined degrees of freedom. The tunability of the underlying domain distribution and its strong anisotropy could also be useful for developing functional devices and applications.',\n",
       "   \"The $R\\\\mathrm{BaC}{\\\\mathrm{o}}_{4}{\\\\mathrm{O}}_{7}$ system is a prototype geometrically frustrated magnet in which kagome planes and triangular layers of Co-O tetrahedra interleave. For $R=\\\\mathrm{Y}$, an antiferromagnetic ground state is realized due to a frustration-breaking trigonal-orthorhombic phase transition. For $R=\\\\mathrm{Lu}$, however, a long-range ordered state has rarely, if ever, been reported despite a similar symmetry-breaking transition, albeit at a significantly lower temperature. To explore this dichotomy, we present a comprehensive magnetic and structural phase diagram for ${\\\\mathrm{Y}}_{1--x}\\\\mathrm{L}{\\\\mathrm{u}}_{x}\\\\mathrm{BaC}{\\\\mathrm{o}}_{4}{\\\\mathrm{O}}_{7}$, established through complementary neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements. Our results outline the phase evolution of the nuclear structures in response to changes in composition and temperature. The temperature of the trigonal ($P31c$) to orthorhombic ($Pbn{2}_{1}$) transition, ${T}_{\\\\mathrm{s}1}$, decreases monotonically with increasing Lu content from 310 K for $x=0.0$ to 110 K for $x=1.0$. In Lu-rich compositions ($0.7\\\\ensuremath{\\\\le}x\\\\ensuremath{\\\\le}1.0$), first-order structural transitions are observed with coexisting and competing orthorhombic $Pbn{2}_{1}$ and metastable monoclinic $\\\\mathit{Cc}$ phases. For the magnetically ordered Y-rich compositions, $T$- and $x$-dependent refinements of the magnetic structure reveal an antiferromagnetic ``ribbonlike'' arrangement of Co spin pairs in both the triangular and the kagome layers. A gradual suppression of long-range magnetic order is observed with increasing the Lu content, accompanied by the development of short-range magnetic correlations present in all the samples.\"],\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

       "   'Given the key constitutional role of electors in the final selection of the U.S. President one might expect the appointed electors to act in the electoral spotlight. But that has seldom been the case, although their meeting to cast their ballot in recent years is often broadcast or videoed and highlighted on their day of action while numbers of the electors do interviews with their local media. Who are the presidential electors? This research addresses this question focusing on the electors and the process of their selection from the vantage point of the 2020 election. It offers reflection on the role electors play in the presidential electoral process in contemporary times from a democratic perspective, focusing on questions of why we might care about who they are, what their experiences are like, and their reflections on that experience. To address the central questions of this essay, that is, who contemporary electors are, how they are selected and how do they perform their electoral job and what has been their assessment of their duties, I have collected both quantitative and qualitative data about the 2020 electoral college members across the states. Quantitative data have been collected on various demographic characteristics of the electors. From the qualitative perspective, I have undertaken interviews with a sample of individual electors and supplemented those interviews with information from media reports on and interviews with individual electors about themselves and their experiences. Who they are, how they function relative to the vision of the founding fathers and what might be the implications for the role of the Electoral College in the democratic process of electing the US president? These are the major questions of this research project. It also explores the 2020 election issue of “fake electors.”',\n",

       "   \"Single-particle pulse radiolyses were performed with an aim of studying fast processes occurring in the spurs produced by γ-rays, positrons, α-particles and positive muons. Observed phenomena were solute fluorescence for γ-ray and α-particle irradiations, Ps formation for positron irradiation, and diamagnetic muon formation for positive muons. The effects of electron scavengers on these different phenomena were measured and compared. The electron scavenger effects on the solute fluorescence in γ-induced spurs in cyclohexane were found to be described fairly well by the WAS (Warman-Asmus-Schuler's) empirical equation, ensuring that charge-transfer mechanism is overwhelming in the fluorescence in cyclohexane. A remarkable parallelism has been observed between the electron scavenger effects on Ps formation and on the solute fluorescence, and the deviations from the parallelism were suggestive of the particular nature of the intraspur processes in the positron spur. The results, together with the Monte Carlo simulation, indicated that the positron spur resembles the γ-induced spur, but possibly contains a plural number of ion pairs. An evidence for a possible role of excited molecular state on Ps formation is also presented. The scavenger effects on α-induced fluorescence roughly followed the WAS equation in cyclohexane, which suggested that the fluorescence takes place in the spurs created by the δ-rays and not in the track. Fluorescence-time profiles which were different for cyclohexane and benzene also gave important information about the intraspur processes. The efficiency of the scavengers on diamagnetic muon formation was far smaller than in radiation chemistry and Ps formation. This implies that the muon spur (within the spur model of muonium formation) is small, or that muonium is formed by an epithermal process rather than the spur process.\"],\n",

       "   \"The success of any law review can be gauged, though in part only, by the impact of the ideas within its published works. Impact depends, in part, on law review visibility. Review success is often hampered, however, by the shortcomings in journal visibility. The shortcomings in the means utilized by reviews to promote their works have plagued legal journals for years. Some reviews do better, with their efforts able to inform others.Opportunities for enhanced law review impact chiefly arise from the new technologically-based mechanisms for delivering information. Unfortunately, these mechanisms are generally underutilized by law reviews. Opportunities for impact enhancement are available for the solicitation, editing, and distribution stages of journal publication.As to solicitation, law reviews need to be far more proactive, and creative. Reliance solely or chiefly on unsolicited pieces pouring in through Scholastica or otherwise is not usually wise. In revamping solicitation efforts, reforms should vary across reviews. A specialty journal should solicit outside authors differently than a general article journal. Solicitation processes involving student authors should be rethought by all journals.As to editing, law reviews need to shorten the time taken in editing by scheduling heavy duty staff oversight of upcoming publications around the typical law student's school and work schedule. Where possible, law reviews should adopt an approach encompassing light edits, quick turn arounds, and expeditious publications, at least for some writings, as with distinctions made, for example, between short essays and lengthy lead articles. As to distribution of published works, law reviews need to eliminate print versions. With electronic publishing only, it is easier to promote scheduled as well as published works. Promotion of scheduled works can be done through preprint SSRN submissions. Promotion of published works can be done through not only SSRN updates, but also wide-scale electronic distribution to those likely interested, including cited authors, judges, lawyers, law school personnel, and other academicians.\",\n",
       "   'This Article advocates law review reforms that would enhance the impact of the ideas within various journals’ published works. Opportunities, yet not often seized, chieﬂy arise from the new technologically based mechanisms for delivering information. Impact enhancement can be achieved with major, yet low effort, reforms to the solicitation, editing, and distribution stages of journal publication.',\n",

       "   'Not that long ago most children born in the United States were conceived by consensual sex involving a husband and wife. After nonmarital births and related governmental child support assistance steadily increased, Congress enacted laws in the 1990s that made federal aid to states providing such support contingent upon easy, inexpensive and fairly immutable paternity establishment laws, which could then be used by governments for financial aid reimbursements. These laws largely encompassed in-hospital voluntary paternity acknowledgments (VPAs). Federal subsidies were dependent upon both certain paternity acknowledgment processes and effective enforcement.The federally-mandated VPA processes included signatures by birthgiver and \"putative father;\" a recission period of 60 days by either signatory; a requirement that post 60 day VPA challenges be based on fraud, duress or material mistake of fact; and, compulsory state recognitions of VPAs properly executed in other states. The availability of voluntary parentage acknowledgments beyond VPAs has exploded in recent years, providing signing opportunities for those, both men and women, having no genetic ties with acknowledged children born of sex. Further, voluntary parentage acknowledgments, including VPAs, are increasingly available beyond births arising from nonmarital sex. Husbands with no genetic ties can, at times, execute parentage acknowledgments with their wives who gave birth. Intended parents of children conceived through nonsurrogacy assisted reproduction can now sometimes employ parentage acknowledgments. In Illinois, parentage acknowledgments are primarily guided by the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015. Some important VPA issues under the Act arose in the recent Appellate Court case of Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services ex rel. Hull v. Robinson. There, an Iowa VPA signed by a man who was not the genetic father was challenged in Illinois when Illinois child support reimbursement was sought from the genetic father.This article critically examines, and urges reforms of, current Illinois VPA and other parentage acknowledgment laws. It first reviews the Robinson ruling, including both the VPA issues that were raised and some unstated VPA issues. It then examines the current availability of voluntary parentage acknowledgments in Illinois, beyond VPAs, as for children born of consensual sex and children born of nonsurrogacy or surrogacy assisted reproduction. Thereafter, it explores the 2000 and 2017 Uniform Parentage Acts [UPAs] on parentage acknowledgments, as well as state parentage acknowledgment laws outside of Illinois. This inquiry should aid Illinois lawmakers in reform efforts, including expanded parentage acknowledgment opportunities involving both current and future parenthood. The article posits reforms of Illinois laws on both paternity and maternity (i.e., relevant genetic ties) acknowledgments and on other parentage (i.e., no genetic ties) acknowledgments, though recognizing a need for differentiating between them.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The precise direction of the off-cut of a vicinal crystal surface determines the azimuth (in-plane angle) of the surface steps and thus their kink density. Here we develop a Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) theory for step-flow crystal growth that includes the effects of step azimuth. We focus on the basal-plane surfaces of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and related crystal structures, for which surface steps have alternating properties that depend on azimuth. We build on a previous treatment that considered only a single-step azimuth, <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><a:mrow><a:mi>ϕ</a:mi><a:mo>=</a:mo><a:mn>0</a:mn></a:mrow></a:math>, that gives alternating steps of pure A and B type. As <b:math xmlns:b=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><b:mi>ϕ</b:mi></b:math> increases from zero, the density of kinks on the steps increases. For hcp-type crystals, in addition the structural difference between alternating steps decreases, until they become equivalent at <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><c:mrow><c:mi>ϕ</c:mi><c:mo>=</c:mo><c:msup><c:mn>30</c:mn><c:mo>∘</c:mo></c:msup></c:mrow></c:math>. We consider the azimuth dependence of the step transparency, attachment, and repulsion parameters of the BCF model, including the effects of both geometrically required and thermally generated kinks. Example calculations are presented that demonstrate the overall effect of step azimuth on BCF predictions for step spacings during steady-state growth and for their dynamics during growth transients. Effects of symmetric and asymmetric step-step repulsion are discussed. Published by the American Physical Society 2024'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Frailty is a multidimensional geriatric syndrome recognized as a critical public health challenge in 771 million aging population worldwide. Although electronic frailty index (eFI) is successfully adopted for frailty screening in developed countries, such a tool is still absent in China. Furthermore, for facilitate early illness prevention, China offers annual physical examinations for the elderly which offers a potential opportunity for the early detection of frailty. This study aimed to develop a new eFI algorithm leveraging routinely collected healthcare data and validated it within both the development and an independent external cohort. Individuals aged 65 or older from the development and external validation cohort were enrolled in this study. Data were extracted from the annual physical examinations and medical records. Based on the cumulative deficit model, a tailored eFI calculation algorithm was developed. The eFI's validity was assessed through correlation with the established FRAIL scale, and its predictive utility for hospitalization and mortality was prospectively evaluated. A set of 30 variables across 13 functional domains was selected to calculate the eFI. It demonstrated a strong correlation with the FRAIL scale (P < 0.001). In the development cohort, individuals categorized as prefrail and frail had higher (62% and 137% respectively) risk of hospitalization compared to the robust group. Regarding all-cause mortality, the risk was also higher (59% and 117% respectively) for prefrail and frail participants. Similar associations were observed in the external validation cohort. Utilizing standardized healthcare records, this study successfully developed and validated an eFI algorithm that can offer a reliable and scalable tool for early frailty screening in China and populations with similar preventive physical examination data.\",\n",
       "   'Materials science exploits only properties that are available at ambience. Therefore, although high-pressure changes the physical state of all condensed matter, most of the extraordinary properties discovered vanish after decompression and cannot be utilized. Here, we demonstrate sublattice decoupling in a mixed-anion chalcohalide Rb6Re6S8I8 upon compression, in which the [Rb6I2]4+ framework is soft and plastic, while the [Re6S8I6]4- clusters are hard and elastic. This discrepancy in the rigidity allows the applied pressure to selectively amorphize the framework while maintaining the ordered state in the cluster, leading to intriguing photocurrent generation and enhancement upon compression. These high-pressure properties are retained at ambience, permitting scalable synthesis of the decompressed samples using a large-volume press, followed by further fabrication into self-powered broadband photodetectors with a response time of ~ 102 μs and a specific detectivity of ~ 1011 Jones. This study subverts the stereotype that pressure engineering is hardly to be employed for device applications.',\n",

We report a family of carbon-supported Sn electrocatalysts with the tin size varying from single atom, ultrasmall clusters to nanocrystallites. High single-product Faradaic efficiency (FE) and low onset potential of CO2 conversion to acetate (FE = 90% @ −0.6 V), ethanol (FE = 92% @ −0.4 V), and formate (FE = 91% @ −0.6 V) were achieved over the catalysts of different active site dimensions. The CO2 conversion mechanism behind these highly selective, size-modulated p-block element catalysts was elucidated by structural characterization and computational modeling, together with kinetic isotope effect investigation.',\n",

       "   'Problems associated with climate change require active implementation of energy-efficiency strategies minimizing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and utilization of renewable energy sources. \"Smart\" window films utilizing thermochromic vanadium dioxide (VO2) can adaptively make use of solar energy to significantly reduce the thermal load of the building by reflecting the infrared portion of the solar spectrum as a result of phase transition caused by heating of the monoclinic M-phase (M) of VO2. In this work, a scalable flow synthesis process has been utilized to screen a broad range of parameter space to target the synthesis of controlled sizes and morphologies of monoclinic VO2 (M) nanoparticles as well as using a doping strategy and surface modifications to enable the tuning of metal to insulator transition temperature in a high-throughput fashion. We have also explored the strategies to increase solar modulation properties of VO2-nanoparticle-based polymer films by (i) changing the morphology of the nanoparticles from spherical into a nanorod structure, (ii) the surface modification of VO2 nanoparticles by low refractive index ligands, and (iii) introduction of additional thermochromic materials to not only boost solar energy modulation but also enable more aesthetically appealing color of designed smart film. By strategically adjusting the VO2 nanoparticle\\'s thermochromic and optical properties, we have achieved 10.0% solar energy modulation for the as-synthesized VO2/polymer composite film and 19.9% solar energy modulation for NLETS [nickel(II) ligand exchange thermochromic system]/PFDA-VO2 hybrid smart films. Moreover, using VO2 nanoparticles with dominant nanorod morphology instead of nanospheres has resulted in more than double increase of thermochromic performance, ΔT at 2000 nm, and in the enhancement of solar energy modulation by 68% in combination ligands with low refractive index. This work provides insights into the design of advanced VO2/polymer composite smart window films.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Tuning the properties of a pair of entangled electron and hole in a light-induced exciton is a fundamentally intriguing inquiry for quantum science. Here, using semiconducting hybrid perovskite as an exploratory platform, we discover that Nd 2+ -doped CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (MAPbI 3 ) perovskite exhibits a Kondo-like exciton-spin interaction under cryogenic and photoexcitation conditions. The feedback to such interaction between excitons in perovskite and the localized spins in Nd 2+ is observed as notably prolonged carrier lifetimes measured by time-resolved photoluminescence, ~10 times to that of pristine MAPbI 3 without Nd 2+ dopant. From a mechanistic standpoint, such extended charge separation states are the consequence of the trap state enabled by the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the light-induced exciton and the localized 4 f spins of the Nd 2+ in the proximity. Importantly, this Kondo-like exciton-spin interaction can be modulated by either increasing Nd 2+ doping concentration that enhances the coupling between the exciton and Nd 2+ 4 f spins as evidenced by elongated carrier lifetime, or by using an external magnetic field that can nullify the spin-dependent exchange interaction therein due to the unified orientations of Nd 2+ spin angular momentum, thereby leading to exciton recombination at the dynamics comparable to pristine MAPbI 3 .',\n",
       "   'Abstract Microporous carbon confined nano silicon composites (Si/m‐C) are considered to be the best anode materials for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries compared with the other Si‐based materials such as SiO, due to high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and capacity, as well as good cycling stability. However, there is a lack of multilevel comprehensive evaluation of Si/m‐C, which poses potential risks to the commercial application. Herein, combined with quantitative titration, mechanical characterization, and bulk/interface evolution analysis, a systematic evolution of commercialized Si/m‐C from the particle level to the cylindrical cell level is conducted, revealing the decay mechanism and proposing corresponding solutions. Among them, it is well demonstrated that the Si/m‐C still withstands huge volume expansion of over 200% with poor mechanical strength, causing the electrical contact loss of active Li x Si and severe interfacial side reactions. Moreover, even blending more than 90% graphite cannot completely suppress its volumetric strain, and the combination of highly flexible single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) is necessary. In response to this, the 32700‐type cylindrical cell with a designed capacity of 9.5 Ah is assembled by mixing Si/m‐C with 90% graphite and SWCNT as anode, achieving a long‐term cycling stability over 300 cycles at 0.5 C with a capacity retention of 94.8%.',\n",

Methods Epidemiological study developed through the analysis of data obtained from an online questionnaire, between 2019 and 2022, distributed among baseball athletes in the state of São Paulo. Results 98 athletes participated in the study, with an average age of 24.3 years, 85.72% of whom were men. The most prevalent ethnicities are yellow (50%) and white (42.86%) and the majority of athletes have incomplete or complete higher education (75.5%). 88.77% have been training for more than a year and 40.82% work in more than one position. More than half simultaneously practice another sport. 66.32% of athletes present knee complaints or symptoms and 37.75% have suffered a knee injury associated with playing baseball through various mechanisms (contact with the ground, contact with another player, no contact). 59.45% of athletes needed to be removed from practice due to complaints, symptoms or injuries presented. Conclusion Of the athletes interviewed, 66.32% had a knee complaint and 37.75% had already had an injury diagnosed in this joint, the most prevalent being meniscal and ligament injuries. The injury rate was highest in the first year of practice.'],\n",

       "   \"Purpose In order to analyze the role of positive humor in the current market environment, this paper investigates the path of the brand’s self-enhancing humor on consumers' brand attitude. The brands are further divided by different genders and different popularity to make the results of the study more relevant and accurate. Design/methodology/approach This study uses an experimental approach to analyze the impact of brand’s self-enhancing humor on consumer brand attitude. This study was conducted on Credamo (https://www.credamo.com/#/), the largest data collection website in China with a database of over 3 million participants with a wide range of demographic variables. Findings The study found that: (1) the brand’s self-enhancing low humor (vs self-enhancing high humor) can significantly enhance consumers' brand attitude; (2) consumers’ brand confidence mediates the influence of self-enhancing humor on consumers' brand attitude; (3) brand gender plays a moderating role, and brand awareness mediates consumer brand confidence. Research limitations/implications This study conducted experiments only on cell phone and shampoo (two types of product brands). Practical implications This study helps brands to avoid the blind use of self-enhancing humor, and helps brands to appropriately apply positive humor in marketing. Social implications The influence of brand humor marketing in the context of social media is analyzed in depth, which helps brands to improve their marketing methods and further enhance consumers' consumption experience and happiness. Originality/value The study breaks the stereotype of “humor first”, explores the mechanism of the influence of self-enhancing humor on consumer brand attitude.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Quality assessment is a key element for the evaluation of hardware and software involved in image and video acquisition, processing, and visualization. In the medical field, user-based quality assessment is still considered more reliable than objective methods, which allow the implementation of automated and more efficient solutions. Regardless of increasing research on this topic in the last decade, defining quality standards for medical content remains a non-trivial task, as the focus should be on the diagnostic value assessed by expert viewers rather than the perceived quality from naïve viewers, and objective quality metrics should aim at estimating the first rather than the latter. In this paper, we present a survey of methodologies used for the objective quality assessment of medical images and videos, dividing them into visual quality-based and task-based approaches. Visual quality-based methods compute a quality index directly from visual attributes, while task-based methods, being increasingly explored, measure the impact of quality impairments on the performance of a specific task. A discussion on the limitations of state-of-the-art research on this topic is also provided, along with future challenges to be addressed.',\n",

       "   \"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is recognized as a precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder of the brain. The neurodegeneration of brain connectivity networks plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of MCI. Traditionally, brain networks are generated using coarse-grained brain regions, where the regions serve as nodes and their functional or structural connections are used as edges. Recently, a novel finer scale brain folding patterns named 3-hinge gyrus (3HG) was identified, which is defined as the conjunctions coming from three directions on gyral crests. 3HGs have been shown playing an important role in brain network and can serve as hubs. In this study, our objective is to construct a novel 3HG-based finer-scale brain connectome and comprehensively compare its performance with traditional region-based connectome in predicting MCI against Normal Controls (NC). The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of 3HG-based brain connectome, shedding light on the potential of 3HG-based connectomes in capturing intricate neurodegenerative patterns associated with MCI and AD.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is gaining momentum in applications like autonomous driving, industry manufacturing, and surveillance, where the robustness of machine learning algorithms against coding artifacts is one of the key success factors. This work complements the MPEG/JVET standardization efforts in improving the resilience of deep neural network (DNN)-based machine models against such coding artifacts by proposing the following three advanced fine-tuning procedures for their training: (1) the progressive increase of the distortion strength as the training proceeds; (2) the incorporation of a regularization term in the original loss function to minimize the distance between predictions on compressed and original content; and (3) a joint training procedure that combines the proposed two approaches. These proposals were evaluated against a conventional fine-tuning anchor on two different machine tasks and datasets: image classification on ImageNet and semantic segmentation on Cityscapes. Our joint training procedure is shown to reduce the training time in both cases and still obtain a 2.4% coding gain in image classification and 7.4% in semantic segmentation, whereas a slight increase in training time can bring up to 9.4% better coding efficiency for the segmentation. All these coding gains are obtained without any additional inference or encoding time. As these advanced fine-tuning procedures are standard-compliant, they offer the potential to have a significant impact on visual coding for machine applications.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONSResults from our exploratory study of restaurant worker mental models of injury and safety emphasize the need for improved occupational safety in the culinary industry through targeted interventions for chefs and managers. The analysis we performed showed that managers possess more integrated and coherent mental models of injury and safety than chefs, reflected in network parameters showing better organization of safety concepts. Kitchen training programs should focus on bridging gaps in safety awareness and mitigating hazards such as burns, cuts, slips, and equipment-related risks. Given their stronger understanding of safety protocols, managers are well positioned to lead kitchen staff training. Leadership-focused training for managers is vital for improving communication, enforcing protocols, and leveraging their integrated mental models of injury and safety in daily practice. Continuous education tailored to the specific responsibilities of chefs and managers is essential for ensuring effective safety training and maintaining standards.',\n",

       "   'Abstract Social interaction plays a crucial role in human societies, encompassing complex dynamics among individuals. To understand social interaction at the neural level, researchers have utilized hyperscanning in several social settings. These studies have mainly focused on inter-brain synchrony and the efficiency of paired functional brain networks, examining group interactions in dyads. However, this approach may not fully capture the complexity of multiple interactions, potentially leading to gaps in understanding inter-network differences. To overcome this limitation, the present study aims to bridge this gap by introducing methodological enhancements using the multilayer network approach, which is tailored to extract features from multiple networks. We applied this strategy to analyze the triad condition during social behavior processes to identify group interaction indices. Additionally, to validate our methodology, we compared the multilayer networks of triad conditions with group synchrony to paired conditions without group synchrony, focusing on statistical differences between alpha and beta waves. Correlation analysis between inter-brain and group networks revealed that this methodology accurately reflects the characteristics of actual behavioral synchrony. The findings of our study suggest that measures of paired brain synchrony and group interaction may exhibit distinct trends, offering valuable insights into interpreting group synchrony.',\n",

       "   'Abstract Looming sounds are known to influence visual function in the brain, even as early as the primary visual cortex. However, despite evidence that looming sounds have a larger impact on cortical excitability than stationary sounds, the influence of varying looming strengths on visual ability remains unclear. Here, we aim to understand how these signals influence low‐level visual function. Fourteen healthy undergraduate students participated. They were blindfolded and received transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the primary visual cortex following auditory stimulation with different strength looming sounds. Participants reported whether they perceived a phosphene, or an illusory visual percept, following TMS stimulation. We hypothesized that rates of phosphene activity would increase with increasing levels of looming strength. A linear mixed‐effect model showed that phosphene activity was significantly higher at higher strength of looming ( F (1, 69) = 5.33, p = .024) and at higher TMS pulse strength ( F (1, 18) = 4.71, p = .043). However, there was also a significant interaction between looming strength and pulse strength ( F (1, 69) = 4.33, p = .041). At lower levels of TMS strength, phosphene rate increased with looming strength, while at higher levels of TMS strength the effect was reversed. These results suggest a complex relationship between looming strength and cortical activity, potentially reflecting the mixed contribution of total auditory energy and the rate of changes. This work will enhance our ability to predict audiovisual interactions and may help improve auditory warning systems designed to capture visual attention.'],\n",

Here, we report the modulation of the local environment at Fe–N4 sites via the application of atomic Sn–Nx sites for simultaneously improved durability and activity. We discovered that Sn–Nx sites not only promote the formation of the more stable D2 FeN4C10 sites but also invoke a unique D3 SnNx–FeIIN4 site that is characterized by having atomically dispersed bridged Sn–Nx and Fe–N4. This new D3 site exhibits significantly improved stability against demetalation and several times higher turnover frequency for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the shift of the reaction pathway from a single-site associative mechanism to a dual-site dissociative mechanism with the adjacent Sn site facilitating a lower overpotential cleavage of the O–O bond. This mechanism bypasses the formation of the otherwise inevitable intermediate that is responsible for demetalation, where two hydroxyl intermediates bind to one Fe site. As a result, a mesoporous Fe/Sn-PNC catalyst exhibits a positively shifted ORR half-wave potential and more than 50% lower peroxide formation. This, in combination with the stable D3 site and enriched D2 Fe sites, significantly enhanced the catalyst's durability as demonstrated in membrane electrode assemblies using complementary accelerated durability testing protocols.\"],\n",

Our results show that the mean potential energies along both the major and minor axes increase with bacterial concentration but decrease with trap stiffness. Notably, the average potential energy along the major axis consistently exceeds that along the minor axis. This discrepancy from equilibrium systems is primarily attributed to the distinct bacterial flow fields and direct bacterium-plate collisions near the major and minor axes, as evidenced by the higher orientational order around the plate along the major compared to the minor axis, despite identical bacterial densities in these regions.

While deviating from those of the densities of electrons (${n}_{\\\\mathrm{e}}$) and holes (${n}_{\\\\mathrm{h}}$) obtained from the two-band model analysis of the magnetoconductivities, the temperature dependence of ${n}_{\\\\mathrm{T}}$ is close to that of the Hall carrier densities ${n}_{\\\\mathrm{H}}$ calculated from the slopes of ${\\\\ensuremath{\\\\rho}}_{xy}(H)$ curves at low magnetic fields, providing a different way to obtain the thermal factor in the extended Kohler's rule.\",\n",
       "   'Electronic textiles (E-textiles) offer great wearing comfort and unobtrusiveness, thus holding potential for next-generation health monitoring wearables. However, the practical implementation is hampered by challenges associated with poor signal quality, substantial motion artifacts, durability for long-term usage, and non-ideal user experience. Here, we report a cost-effective E-textile system that features 3D microfiber-based electrodes for greatly increasing the surface area. The soft and fluffy conductive microfibers disperse freely and securely adhere to the skin, achieving a low impedance at the electrode-skin interface even in the absence of gel. A superhydrophobic fluorinated self-assembled monolayer was deposited on the E-textile surface to render it waterproof while retaining the electrical conductivity. Equipped with a custom-designed motion-artifact canceling wireless data recording circuit, the E-textile system could be integrated into a variety of smart garments for exercise physiology and health monitoring applications. Real-time multimodal electrophysiological signal monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), was successfully carried out during strenuous cycling and even underwater swimming activities. Furthermore, a multi-channel E-textile was developed and implemented in clinical patient studies for simultaneous real-time monitoring of maternal ECG and uterine EMG signals, incorporating spatial-temporal potential mapping capabilities.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Emerging from the intricate interplay of topology and magnetism, the giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is the most known topological property of the recently discovered kagomé ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 with the magnetic Co atoms arranged on a kagomé lattice. Here it is reported that the AHE in Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 can be fine‐tuned by an applied magnetic field orientated within ≈2° of the kagomé plane, while beyond this regime, it stays unchanged. Particularly, it can vanish in magnetic fields parallel to the kagomé plane and even decrease in magnetic fields collinear with the spin direction. This tunable AHE can be attributed to local spin switching enabled by the geometrical frustration of the magnetic kagomé lattice, revealing that spins in a kagomé ferromagnet change their switching behavior as the magnetic field approaches the kagomé plane. These results also suggest a versatile way to tune the properties of a kagomé magnet.'],\n",

       "   '<title>Abstract</title> Variations in Earth’s orbit pace global ice-volume/sea-level changes, but the variability in the response for different sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) to orbitally-forced climate change remains unclear. We present geological records of iceberg-rafted debris (IBRD) and other proxies from locations adjacent to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) spanning ~3.3-2.3 Ma. Iceberg calving events from the WAIS recorded in Ross Sea sediment cores show a linear response to orbital forcing at timescales corresponding to obliquity (40 kyr) and precession (23-19 kyr) modulated by eccentricity (100 kyr). This contrasts with records adjacent to the EAIS, which lack obliquity pacing. Geological data and ice sheet model sensitivity tests show the WAIS is highly dynamic and responsive to oceanic melt driven by changes in Southern Ocean circulation, together with atmospheric forcing through variations in local insolation. Conversely, the EAIS appears less responsive to oceanic forcing, despite being the dominant source of meltwater to the global ocean during the mid-Pliocene. Our results imply a significant role for atmospheric warming on mid-Pliocene sea-level.',\n",
       "   'Drill cores from the Antarctic continental shelf are essential for directly constraining changes in past Antarctic Ice Sheet extent. Here, we provide a sedimentary facies analysis of drill cores from International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1521 in the Ross Sea, which reveals a unique, detailed snapshot of Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution between ca. 18 Ma and 13 Ma. We identify distinct depositional packages, each of which contains facies successions that are reflective of past baseline shifts in the presence or absence of marine-terminating ice sheets on the outermost Ross Sea continental shelf. The oldest depositional package (&amp;gt;18 Ma) contains massive diamictites stacked through aggradation and deposited in a deep, actively subsiding basin that restricted marine ice sheet expansion on the outer continental shelf. A slowdown in tectonic subsidence after 17.8 Ma led to the deposition of progradational massive diamictites with thin mudstone beds/laminae, as several large marine-based ice sheet advances expanded onto the mid- to outer continental shelf between 17.8 Ma and 17.4 Ma. Between 17.2 Ma and 15.95 Ma, packages of interbedded diamictite and diatom-rich mudstone were deposited during a phase of highly variable Antarctic Ice Sheet extent and volume. This included periods of Antarctic Ice Sheet advance near the outer shelf during the early Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO)—despite this being a well-known period of peak global warmth between ca. 17.0 Ma and 14.6 Ma. Conversely, there were periods of peak warmth within the MCO during which diatom-rich mudstones with little to no ice-rafted debris were deposited, which indicates that the Antarctic Ice Sheet was greatly reduced in extent and had retreated to a smaller terrestrial-terminating ice sheet, most notably between 16.3 Ma and 15.95 Ma. Post-14.2 Ma, diamictites and diatomites contain unambiguous evidence of subglacial shearing in the core and provide the first direct, well-dated evidence of highly erosive marine ice sheets on the outermost continental shelf during the onset of the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT; 14.2−13.6 Ma). Although global climate forcings and feedbacks influenced Antarctic Ice Sheet advances and retreats during the MCO and MMCT, we propose that this response was nonlinear and heavily influenced by regional feedbacks related to the shoaling of the continental shelf due to reduced subsidence, sediment infilling, and local sea-level changes that directly influenced oceanic influences on melting at the Antarctic Ice Sheet margin. Although intervals of diatom-rich muds and diatomite indicating open-marine interglacial conditions still occurred during (and following) the MMCT, repeated advances of marine-based ice sheets since that time have resulted in widespread erosion and overdeepening in the inner Ross Sea, which has greatly enhanced sensitivity to marine ice sheet instability since 14.2 Ma.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Quantitatively coding open-ended data (e.g., from videos, interviews) can be a rich source of information in psychological research, but reporting practices vary substantially. We provide strategies for improving validity and reliability of coding open-ended data and investigate questionable research practices in this area. First, we systematically examined articles in four top psychology journals ( N = 956) and found that 21% included open-ended data coded by humans. However, only about one-third of those articles reported sufficient details to replicate or evaluate the validity of the coding process. Next, we propose multiphase guidelines for transparently reporting on the quantitative coding of open-ended data, informed by concerns with replicability, content validity, and statistical validity. The first phase involves research design, including selecting data and identifying units reliably. The second phase includes developing a coding manual and training coders. The final phase outlines how to establish reliability. As part of this phase, we used data simulations to examine a common statistic for testing reliability on open-ended data, Cohen’s κ, and found that it can become inflated when researchers repeatedly test interrater reliability or manipulate categories, such as by including a missing-data category. Finally, to facilitate transparent and valid coding of open-ended data, we provide a preregistration template that reflects these guidelines. All of the guidelines and resources provided in this article can be adapted for different types of studies, depending on context.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Abstract Ability to effectively work in teams is one of the desired outcomes of engineering and engineering technology programs. Unfortunately, working in teams is still challenging for many students. Rather than contributing to team projects, some students resort to social loafing. Social loafing tends to destroy both teamwork performance and individual learning, especially in solving ill-structured problems, such as design. Furthermore, a bad experience on a past team is a significant concern as it could generate negative feelings toward future team projects. Formation of collaborative teams is a critical first step in team-project-based design courses as team composition directly affects not only teamwork processes and outcomes, but also teamwork skills and experience. This NSF-IUSE sponsored project aims to enhance students' teamwork experiences and teamwork learning through 1) understanding how to form better student design teams and 2) identifying exercises that will effectively improve team member collaboration. We do this by comparing student characteristics and design task characteristics with the quality of the design team outcome, and examining the resulting correlations. Student characteristics cover six categories: 1) background information, 2) work structure preferences, 3) personality, 4) ability, 5) motivation, and 6) attitude. Task characteristics and design team outcomes are characterized using the Creative Product Semantic Scale. In this article, we present correlations between student/team characteristics and design project outcome, and correlations between task characteristics and design project outcome for 2020-2021 senior design teams at two institutions. For both institutions, we will present correlations between individual student characteristics and team outcome. For one institution, we will also present correlation between team-level characteristics and team outcomes.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Team building activities are popular interventions during early stages of team development. At [university], in the multidisciplinary capstone course with an average cohort size of around 350, the students on a particular capstone project team may not be mutually acquainted and thus may benefit from such team building activities. Prior literature has studied the effectiveness of various instructor-directed team building activities on student teams. However, our students are generally eager to spend class time working on their projects and often see in-class activities as a distraction rather than an important part of their growth. Instead, the student teams are now allowed to choose an intervention based on team consensus. In this paper, the relationship between attributes of the chosen intervention and student performance, as measured using a series of AACU VALUE rubrics, was studied using statistical measures. The analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of type of team building activity on teamwork, oral communication, and design & problem solving scores of individual students on the team. Also, a statistically significant effect of location of team building activity (on or off campus) on design & problem solving score was observed.'],\n",

However, dimensional regularization is not appropriate for softly broken supersymmetric gauge theories, because it explicitly violates supersymmetry. In this paper, I obtain the three-loop effective potential using a supersymmetric regulator based on dimensional reduction. Checks follow from the vanishing of the effective potential in examples with supersymmetric vacua, and from renormalization-scale invariance in examples for which supersymmetry is broken, either spontaneously or explicitly by soft terms. As by-products, I obtain the three-loop Landau gauge anomalous dimension for the scalar component of a chiral supermultiplet, and the beta function for the field-independent vacuum energy.',\n",

Yet, and on the other hand, these things are not quite like other things. They seem to have social presence. They are able to talk and interact with us. And many are designed to mimic or simulate the capabilities and behaviors that are commonly associated with human or non-human animal intelligence. Robots, therefore, invite and encourage zoomorphism, anthropomorphism, and even personification. This paper sets out to answer the vexing question: What exactly is a robot? Rather than try to fit robots into the existing moral and legal categories by way of arguing for either their reification or personification, however, the paper will argue for a revolutionary reformulation of the entire system, developing a new approach to technology law and ethics that can scale to the unique opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century and beyond.

       "   'Abstract This article contributes to the philosophical inquiry of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by reframing the question “Where is the intelligence of Artificial Intelligence?” into “Where does AI intelligently operate?”. This rephrasing challenges our understanding of AI’s role in social practices and its integration into the human experience. Central to this discourse is the concept of the ‘ cybork ’ (a portmanteau of ‘cyborg’ and ‘work’), which symbolizes not just a physical entity but a dynamic system of actions and interactions within a socio-technical landscape: work accomplished with machines. In this framework, intelligence in AI lies not in any function of isolated systems, but rather in the situated context of their use within collective and meaningful practices that give technology its sense and direction. Conversely, technology both enables and shapes these practices to the extent that distinguishing between the two can seem unnecessary, or even detrimental, to the optimal design of and for work practices. The cybork embodies this integration and entanglement, transcending the traditional boundaries between individuals and collectives, entities and actions. It reveals the inseparability and co-dependence of humans and technology, where technological artifacts become extensions of human capabilities, embody collective human history and development, and serve as both products and participants in societal practices, fundamentally shaping our interaction with the world.',\n",

The workshop assembled a set of innovative papers contributed by researchers from across the globe and from different disciplines. In doing so, the workshop facilitated and staged a wide-ranging conversation about the practical aspects of robot rights that is designed to help us not only understand the current state of research and development in this area but also provide a research framework for future work in this domain. Consequently, the main objective of the workshop is not to advance one, definitive solution but to map the range of possible outcomes and critically evaluate their significance.',\n",

Robots were perceived as slaves without the rights to reproduce, own property, strike, receive a salary, vote or be elected but with the obligations to adhere to regulations and respect humans. Finally, the results showed that respondents did not distinguish completely the ‘can have’ and ‘should have’ options about the respective rights and obligations.

They are rooted in foundational concepts regarding language and technology that have been definitive of Western systems of knowing since the time of Plato.

Exploring key advancements such as machine translation, natural language processing, large language models, computational creativity, and social robotics, this book shows how these innovations not only disrupt but also actively transform human communication. The book is designed for students, teachers, and general readers who want to know how the field of communication impacts and influences the theory and practice of AI and how recent developments in AI will affect all aspects of human social interaction. &nbsp',\n",

       "   'Artificial intelligence is having a transformative effect across the spectrum of human endeavor. But along with the remarkable opportunities and promises heralded by these technologies, there are also significant challenges. Responses to these challenges have taken shape and been organized under the umbrella of what has been called the ethics of AI. But these efforts have not been without their own set of difficulties. First and foremost is the fact that the field tends to rely on Western/European moral and legal philosophies, meaning that the frameworks currently being utilized to address the big challenges of AI run the risk of reproducing many of the difficulties that the field seeks to redress. The Handbook of the Ethics of AI is deliberately designed to respond to this problem by diversifying the field of AI ethics, opening it to others and other ways of thinking and doing ethics. This introduction provides an overview of the book and its contents.',\n",

       "   'This essay examines whether and to what extent the \"other\" in communicative interactions may be otherwise than another human subject and the moral opportunities and challenges this alteration would make available to us. Toward this end, the analysis proceeds in five steps or movements. The first reviews the way the discipline of communication has typically perceived and theorized the role and function of technology. The second and third parts investigate the critical challenges that emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence applications and robots, poses to this standard instrumentalist way of thinking. The fourth part introduces an alternative called \"relational ethics,\" which effectively flips the script on the usual way of proceeding. And the fifth part presents and responds to one important and notable objection to this alternative. The goal in all of this is not to complicate things but to introduce and formulate a techno-ethics that is more agile in its response to the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century and beyond.',\n",
       "   \"The perceived problem with large language models (LLM) is that we appear to be on the verge of being inundated with written texts where we have logos but cannot credibly identify ethos. If it is increasingly difficult or even impossible to ascertain who or what does the talking, it will, so the argument goes, be challenging to evaluate and decide the validity or truth of what has been stated. This chapter agrees with the critics, but instead of bemoaning this as a loss, it celebrates its revolutionary potential, demonstrating how LLMs disrupt the defining conditions of both classical rhetoric and modern literary theory. It does so by tracing the ways that LLMs deconstruct logocentric metaphysics and developing a new concept of writing or text generation by returning to a pre-Aristotelian formulation that can be found in Plato's Phaedrus. The objective of the effort is to provide an alternative conceptualization of the production of text and the evaluation of credibility that does not depend upon the usual way of doing things.\"],\n",

       "   'Educational technology (EdTech) research should champion the values of open science in order to be robust, methodologically rigorous, collaborative, inclusive, and transparent. ‘Open science’ is, broadly, an approach to scientific scholarship that adopts tools to promote openness, mitigate against bias, enhance opportunity for collaboration, and reduce questionable research practices. EdTech research often involves collaborative empirical work with partnerships between academia, industry, and policymakers, often with competing stakeholder timelines, agendas, and expectations. It also employs a diversity of methodologies and epistemologies, given the broad goals of EdTech as a field. Taken together, these unique features of EdTech research mean there is a distinct set of contextual and methodological challenges for engagement with open science tools and initiatives. Here, we write as a collective of academics, scholars, and industry representatives who all work in the EdTech space and hope to envisage a future for how EdTech researchers can meaningfully engage in calls to ‘open up’ science. We share insights from a stakeholder workshop event, hosted by CERES (Connecting the Educational Technology Research Ecosystem). We summarize four main open science practices: (1) open data, (2) study pre-registration, (3) positionality and conflict of interest statements, and (4) CRediT taxonomy of contributorship. For each of the practices, we summarize the key opportunities for EdTech research and highlight the unique disciplinary challenges that academics and industry must negotiate when integrating open science into EdTech research. We show how open science is an ally to EdTech research, but careful consideration about its implementation is needed.',\n",

The layered honeycomb Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ has been singled out as a leading candidate provided that the trigonal crystal field acting on Co $3d$ orbitals, which enhances non-Kitaev exchange interactions between $J_{\\\\rm eff}=\\\\frac{1}{2}$ spin-orbital pseudospins, is reduced. We find that applied pressure leads to anisotropic compression of the layered structure, significantly reducing the trigonal distortion of CoO$_6$ octahedra. A strong enhancement of ferromagnetic correlations between pseudospins is observed in the spin-polarized (3 Tesla) phase up to about 60 GPa. Higher pressures drive a spin transition into a low-spin state destroying the $J_{\\\\rm eff}=\\\\frac{1}{2}$ local moments required to map the spin Hamiltonian into Kitaev's model. The spin transition strongly suppresses the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and appears to stabilize a paramagnetic phase driven by frustration. Although applied pressure fails to realize a KQSL state, the possible emergence of frustrated magnetism of localized, low-spin $S=\\\\frac{1}{2}$ moments opens the door for exploration of novel magnetic quantum states in compressed honeycomb lattices of divalent cobaltates.\",\n",

The gender gaps in career outcomes (e.g., pay, promotion, leadership opportunities) observably widen during mid-career, yet research often neglects considerations of gendered age identities in explaining this disparity. The present paper addresses this through an integrative review of interdisciplinary literature and proposes a novel theoretical framework that combines midlife development and gender identity negotiations to better understand mid-career disparities. In this review, we (1) adopt an inter-categorical approach to explore how workers navigate the overlapping systems of gender and age in the workplace, (2) critically review midlife development literature, highlighting significant oversights in organizational research, and (3) we introduce a process model of midlife gendered identity negotiations. We detail the model, describing the antecedents, mechanisms, and outcomes of gendered aging identity negotiations on mid-career inequities. We provide a foundation for advancing research and designing interventions to address gender disparities in mid-career outcomes.',\n",
       "   'Introduction: Implementation of telehealth (TH) accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and has become a vital part of health care delivery. As we move toward the post-COVID-19 era, clinical practice has demonstrated a need for updated policies and quality improvement to solidify the role of TH in the urology care setting. The AUA Census data were used to explore trends, benefits, and barriers to urology TH implementation. Methods: The AUA Workforce Workgroup and Telehealth Taskforce analyzed data from the 2019-2022 AUA Census. Pertinent variables included utilization, patient satisfaction, care settings, quality, and diagnoses amenable to TH. Results: Pre-COVID-19 TH utilization increased from 11.9% to 81% during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. TH is predominately used in metropolitan academic centers, with usage increasing from 12.8% to 83% in these areas during the pandemic. Usage also increased in non-metropolitan areas from 3.8% to 61.2%. Overall, 76.7% reported increased ease of scheduling follow-ups, 62% ease of ordering tests, and 69.5% ease of accessing patient data in favor of audio visits vs in-person visits. TH utilization increased from 42.4% to 65% for initial visits and 66.8% to 82% for follow-up visits.

As we move towards the post COVID era, clinical practice has demonstrated a need for updated policies and quality improvement to solidify the role of TH in the urology care setting. The AUA census data was used to explore trends, benefits, and barriers to urology TH implementation. METHODS: The AUA Workforce Workgroup and Telehealth Taskforce analyzed data from the 2019-2022 AUA census. Pertinent variables included utilization, patient satisfaction, care settings, quality, and diagnoses amenable to TH. RESULTS: Pre-COVID TH utilization increased from 11.9% to 94% during and post-COVID. TH is predominately used in metropolitan academic centers, with usage increasing from 12.8% to 66.7% in these areas during the pandemic. Usage also increased in rural areas from 3.8% to 42.3%. 72.7% reporting increased ease of scheduling follow-ups, ordering tests, and accessing patient data. TH utilization increased from 42.4% to 65% for initial visits and 66.8% to 82% for follow-up visits. 65% of patients and 88.2% of practicing urologists under the age of 54 desire the use of telemedicine. TH increased patient access to care by 51.6%, and 54% of urologists expressed desire to continue using or increase utilization of TH. The top three barriers of patient's ability to receive telemedicine were 67.6% noting lack of knowledge in using patient portal/software needed for telemedicine visits, 49.4% had lack of adequate conferencing tools, and 43.9% lacked high-speed internet service to enable video visits. 53.4% of urologists would absolutely or probably increase usage if payment parity of telehealth was comparable to in-office E/M services. CONCLUSIONS: TH implementation accelerated during the COVID-19 era. In the post COVID era TH continues to be valued across multiple areas including patient and physician satisfaction, and increased access to care, particularly in rural areas. Barriers exist, especially concerning payment parity, and could be eliminated through advocacy for policy updates and standardization of technology.

       "   'Purpose While sex discrimination and race discrimination are prevalent in the workplace, a relatively low proportion of those who experience it choose to voice. This paper aims to investigate why individuals choose to voice or not voice discrimination by exploring the role of metastereotypes – beliefs about what others think about a group one belongs to – with respect to voicing or not voicing discrimination at work. Design/methodology/approach Of the 475 participants surveyed, 34% (164 respondents) had experienced either race or sex discrimination. The metastereotypes of these 164 respondents who either voiced (31%) or did not voice (69%) sex or race discrimination were gathered and examined with respect to the themes and valence of the descriptors. Differences in the content and valence of metastereotypes were examined from different samples taken at two different time periods to explore the possible influence of social movements (#MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter). Findings These qualitative analyses provide new insights into how people making different choices regarding the voicing of their mistreatment believe they are viewed. Metastereotypes differed to some extent in content and valence depending on perceiver, source, type of discrimination and timing. Social implications This can assist in the development of strategies to encourage voicing with the ultimate goal of reducing workplace mistreatment. Originality/value This paper provides the critical first step for including metastereotypes in the model to predict voice in the workplace.'],\n",

       "   \"Illinois and 13 other states impose a sales tax on groceries. Foods subject to the state's 1% grocery tax are generally healthier than alternatives such as junk and restaurant foods, yet they are taxed more heavily. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker proposes to eliminate the grocery tax in his state fiscal year 2025 budget, but policymakers and advocates have two important concerns. First, since food purchases make up a higher share of lower-income household's budgets compared to better-off households, the tax has been criticized for being highly regressive. But it is important to note that the grocery purchases of SNAP participants, who are the lowest-income households, are exempt from tax. While this means that the grocery tax is not regressive from the perspective of the poorest families, it is the case that lower- and middle-income families pay a higher share of their incomes to grocery taxes than the top 40% of households by income. Second, when groceries are taxed, this raises their cost relative to less healthy junk and restaurant foods. A rigorous study indicates only a very small percentage of people shift away from food at home due to grocery taxes. The tax has much less impact than popularly portrayed since grocery purchases are actually very low. However, many Illinois municipalities rely on the grocery tax as part of their revenue. Governor Pritzker does not propose a way of recouping this lost revenue, nor give local governments much time to implement a solution for the proposed July 1 tax elimination date. There are several reasons why it may be difficult for local governments to replace the grocery tax in a timely fashion and it's important to note that alternatives to the grocery tax may be even worse in their regressivity.\",\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract Unexpected and often severe weather has taxed community capacities. Convincing households to prepare by developing emergency plans, keeping necessary supplies, and investing in home upgrades, to name a few, has been a focus of many public campaigns related to extreme weather. Essentially, these programmes are exercises in persuasion. What, then, characterises such a campaign that is likely to be successful in this act of persuasion? Recent work has found that household preparedness may be related to trust in government, as a key emergency information provider, although the evidence is mixed. In this article, we argue that the mixed evidence scholars have found may come from the measurement of trust in government. Our statistical analysis shows that increases in minimum trust in levels of government decreases household preparedness for tornadoes. The finding highlights the importance of augmenting and restoring social trust (in addition to trust in government) to produce better emergency management outcomes in the United States.',\n",
       "   'We examine the shape of policy change in the US federal bureaucracy. Punctuated equilibrium suggests institutional friction and limited attention as prime influences on policy change. We build on this literature by exploring how organisational forms shape policy change. We also conceptualise the key difference between budgets and laws as measures and use this distinction to motivate our new approach to modelling the shape of policy change. We use the considerable organisational variation in the US federal bureaucracy as the empirical foundation for the analysis, collecting a new data set on the regulatory agenda containing 63,289 items from 2008 to 2016. We use an innovative points-over-threshold approach to show how to move from typical descriptive analysis of policy change distributions to models of tail behaviour. This approach is more amenable to textual data than previous approaches based on percentage change distributions. The findings suggest that departmental bureaucracies, independent boards and commissions, and government corporations experience different patterns of policy change. We relate organisation and delegation to adaptability and resiliency in institutional and policy-system design. Larger organisations exhibit smoother, less disjointed policy dynamics, while smaller organisational forms exhibit fatter tails and less adaptive policy change. Our findings suggest that larger bureaucracies may handle change in task environments and problem definitions more easily than smaller organisations. The findings challenge the typical view that smaller, nimble organisations handle change better.',\n",

       "   'Protein hydrolysates from sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) gonads are rich in active materials with remarkable angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Alcalase was used to hydrolyze sea cucumber gonads, and the hydrolysate was separated by the ultrafiltration membrane to produce a low-molecular-weight peptide component (less than 3 kDa) with good ACE inhibitory activity. The peptide component (less than 3 kDa) was isolated and purified using a combination method of ACE gel affinity chromatography and reverse high-performance liquid chromatography. The purified fractions were identified by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), and the resulting products were filtered using structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) to obtain 20 peptides. Of those, three noncompetitive inhibitory peptides (DDQIHIF with an IC50 value of 333.5 μmol·L−1, HDWWKER with an IC50 value of 583.6 μmol·L−1, and THDWWKER with an IC50 value of 1291.8 μmol·L−1) were further investigated based on their favorable pharmacochemical properties and ACE inhibitory activity. Molecular docking studies indicated that the three peptides were entirely enclosed within the ACE protein cavity, improving the overall stability of the complex through interaction forces with the ACE active site. The total free binding energies (ΔGtotal) for DDQIHIF, HDWWKER, and THDWWKER were −21.9 Kcal·mol−1, −71.6 Kcal·mol−1, and −69.1 Kcal·mol−1, respectively. Furthermore, a short-term assay of antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) revealed that HDWWKER could significantly decrease the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs after intravenous administration. The results showed that based on the better antihypertensive activity of the peptide in SHRs, the feasibility of targeted affinity purification and computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) for the efficient screening and preparation of ACE inhibitory peptide was verified, which provided a new idea of modern drug development method for clinical use.',\n",
       "   'Rationale: Comamonas kerstersii mainly causes intra-abdominal infections with favorable outcomes due to high antibiotic susceptibility. We report the first case of pneumonia caused by C Kerstersii , which promoted patient death, and a second urinary tract infection by C Kerstersii with extensive drug resistance. Patient concerns: A 46-year-old male (Case 1) with craniocerebral injury underwent emergency decompressive craniectomy, but his condition deteriorated further and presented with discontinuous fever, small moist rales on both lungs, and respiratory failure. Retrospective average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis of the genomic sequence of the sputum isolate identified it as C Kerstersii 12322-1, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) revealed that it was sensitive to 18 of 21 tested antibiotics. An 82-year-old male (Case 2) with hypertrophic prostate experienced gradual obstruction during urination, and a urine test revealed WBC ++. Retrospective ANI analysis of the urine isolate identified it as C Kerstersii 121606, which was resistant to 18 of 21 tested antibiotics. Diagnoses: Case 1 was diagnosed empirically as pneumonia caused by C Kerstersii strain 12322-1 secondary to craniocerebral injury and confirmed by retrospective ANI analysis; case 2 was diagnosed empirically as urinary infection secondary to prostate hyperplasia caused by C Kerstersii strain 121606 confirmed by the retrospective ANI analysis. Interventions: Case 1 was administered cefoxitin, cefodizime, imipenem-cilastatin sodium, and underwent comprehensive salvage management. Case 2 was administered doxycycline alone. Outcomes: Case 1 died partially because of untimely identification of the responsible bacteria-12322-1. Case 2 was cured even 121606 exhibited an extensive drug resistance feature. Lessons: Except for intra-abdominal infections with good prognosis, we verified that C Kerstersii could also cause extra-abdominal infections, such as the first pneumonia case and urinary infection. It could promote patient death; actual infections were underestimated due to identification difficulties, posing a health threat due to the presence of extensive drug resistance.',\n",
       "   'Elizabethkingia anophelis MSU001, isolated from Anopheles stephensi in the laboratory, was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/MS), biochemical testing, and genome sequencing. Average nucleotide identity analysis revealed 99% identity with the type species E. anophelis R26. Phylogenetic placement showed that it formed a clade with other mosquito-associated strains and departed from a clade of clinical isolates. Comparative genome analyses further showed that it shared at least 98.6% of genes with mosquito-associated isolates (except E. anophelis As1), while it shared at most 88.8% of common genes with clinical isolates. Metabolites from MSU001 significantly inhibited growth of E. coli but not the mosquito gut symbionts Serratia marcescens and Asaia sp. W12. Insect-associated E. anophelis carried unique glycoside hydrolase (GH) and auxiliary activities (AAs) encoding genes distinct from those of clinical isolates, indicating their potential role in reshaping chitin structure and other components involved in larval development or formation of the peritrophic matrix. Like other Elizabethkingia, MSU001 also carried abundant genes encoding two-component system proteins (51), transcription factor proteins (188), and DNA-binding proteins (13). E. anophelis MSU001 contains a repertoire of antibiotic resistance genes and several virulence factors. Its potential for opportunistic infections in humans should be further evaluated prior to implementation as a paratransgenesis agent (by transgenesis of a symbiont of the vector).',\n",
       "   'Protein loop modeling is a challenging yet highly nontrivial task in protein structure prediction. Despite recent progress, existing methods including knowledge-based, ab initio, hybrid, and deep learning (DL) methods fall substantially short of either atomic accuracy or computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we present KarmaLoop, a novel paradigm that distinguishes itself as the first DL method centered on full-atom (encompassing both backbone and side-chain heavy atoms) protein loop modeling. Our results demonstrate that KarmaLoop considerably outperforms conventional and DL-based methods of loop modeling in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, with the average RMSDs of 1.77 and 1.95 Å for the CASP13+14 and CASP15 benchmark datasets, respectively, and manifests at least 2 orders of magnitude speedup in general compared with other methods. Consequently, our comprehensive evaluations indicate that KarmaLoop provides a state-of-the-art DL solution for protein loop modeling, with the potential to hasten the advancement of protein engineering, antibody-antigen recognition, and drug design.',\n",

       "   'Abstract For female domestic cats, ovariohysterectomy is the only method of inducing permanent infertility. However, hundreds-of-millions of free-roaming cats globally highlight the necessity for alternative contraceptive approaches. One strategy involves a single injection of vector delivering a fertility-inhibiting protein for lifetime contraception. Recent studies in mice and cats have identified anti-Müllerian hormone as an excellent candidate for this type of contraception. Here, we leverage our recent characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying human anti-Müllerian hormone synthesis and activity, to generate potent feline anti-Müllerian hormone analogs. Single intramuscular delivery of these analogs to female cats using an adeno-associated viral vector leads to a greater than 1000-fold increase in feline anti-Müllerian hormone levels, which are sustained for 9 months. High serum anti-Müllerian hormone is associated with abnormal estrus cyclicity, non-follicular ovarian cyst formation, and a progressive decline in antral follicle numbers, however, the few surviving large follicles continue to ovulate. Unlike previous studies, supraphysiologic levels of anti-Müllerian hormone do not block conception, although they are incompatible with the maintenance of pregnancy. Our findings highlight the complexity of the effects of anti-Müllerian hormone on ovarian physiology but confirm that this growth factor is a candidate for fertility control in free-roaming cats.',\n",
       "   'Introduction Children having surgery, and their parents, commonly have anxiety in the preoperative period, and this may impact longer-term health and quality of life. Psychological preparation can be expensive and time-consuming, and the type and effectiveness of preparatory interventions are variable. The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a preoperative smartphone psychological preparation application with virtual reality (VR) capability (the ‘Little Journey app’ (LJ)), at reducing anxiety and its sequelae in children and their carers. Methods and analysis Multicentre, assessor-blinded, two-armed, parallel group, RCT in children aged between 3 and 12 years, undergoing ambulatory surgery and receiving their first general anaesthetic. Randomisation is one-to-one between an intervention and a control arm. Participants in the intervention arm are provided with access to the LJ app and a low-cost cardboard VR headset (to be used with a smartphone) to use in the weeks leading up to their operation. Children in the control arm receive the same VR headset and suggestions of unrelated VR games to play, but no access to the LJ app. To improve accessibility, smart devices are provided to children whose families do not have a smart phone, and the app content has been translated from English into multiple languages. Both groups receive standard perioperative care at the hospital where they are having treatment. The primary outcome measure is the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale-Short Form applied by independent blinded observers, immediately before induction of general anaesthesia. Secondary outcomes include process measures, psychological and socioeconomic outcomes for both children and parents/carers. The planned sample size was 304 participants, including an anticipated 15% attrition rate. An interim analysis was conducted when the trial was temporarily paused because of the COVID-19 pandemic, at which point 119 participants had been recruited. The trial steering committee and data monitoring committee recommended continuation of the trial, but the sample size was increased to 596 to account for differences between the previously anticipated and actual outcomes of recruited participants. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by Surrey Borders—Research Ethics Committee 251219, and all participating sites were in England. Results will be presented in academic manuscripts and presentations and summarised for diverse audiences (including clinicians and patients/public) in podcasts, infographics and other multimedia formats.

       "   '<title>Abstract</title> COVID-19 has led to significant global health impacts, with over 776 million confirmed cases worldwide. While it is primarily known for respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 has also been linked to cognitive impairments, particularly \"brain fog,\" which affects attention, memory, and processing speed. The long-term effects, especially in non-hospitalized individuals, remain poorly understood. Brain fog affects the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, regions responsible for generating the P300, an electrophysiological measure of attention and working memory. The P300 has been used to assess cognitive deficits in various neurological conditions, though rarely in COVID-19. A dual-task paradigm, such as the n-back task, can help detect subtle cognitive impairments. This study compared P300 responses in three groups: individuals with COVID-19 and brain fog, individuals with COVID-19 but no brain fog, and a control group (pre-pandemic). We hypothesized that the brain fog group would show reduced P300 amplitudes, especially under higher n-back loads. Results showed that the brain fog group had smaller P300 amplitudes compared to the other two groups, regardless of task load. No significant differences were found between the brain fog negative and control groups, nor in behavioral measures. These findings suggest that the P300 is a sensitive tool for detecting subtle cognitive impairments in COVID-19 brain fog, which may not be evident in behavioral tests.',\n",

       "   'Abstract The classical androgens, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, together with dehydroepiandrosterone, the precusrsor to all androgens, are generally included in diagnostic steroid evaluations of androgen excess and deficiency disorders and monitored in androgen replacement and androgen suppressive therapies. The C11-oxy androgens also contribute to androgen excess disorders and are still often excluded from clinical and research-based steroids analysis. The contribution of the C11-oxy androgens to the androgen pool has not been considered in androgen deficiency. An exploratory investigation into circulating adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones in men was undertaken as neither the classical androgens nor the C11-oxy androgens have been evaluated in the context of concurrent measurement of all adrenal steroid hormones. Serum androgens, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, progesterones and androgens were assessed in 70 healthy young men using ultra high performance supercritical fluid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Testosterone, 24.5 nmol/L was the most prominent androgen detected in all participants while dihydrotestosterone, 1.23 nmol/L, was only detected in 25% of the participants. The 11-oxy androgens were present in most of the participants with 11-hydroxyandrostenedione, 3.37 nmol, in 98.5%, 11-ketoandrostenedione 0.764 in 77%, 11-hydroxytestosterone, 0.567 in 96% and 11-ketotestosterone: 0.440 in 63%. A third of the participants with normal testosterone and comparable 11-ketotestosterone, had significantly lower dehydroepiandrosterone ( p &lt; 0.001). In these males 11-hydroxyandrostenedione ( p &lt; 0.001), 11-ketoandrostenedione ( p &lt; 0.01) and 11-hydroxytestosterone ( p &lt; 0.006) were decreased. Glucocorticoids were also lower: cortisol ( p &lt; 0.001), corticosterone ( p &lt; 0.001), cortisone ( p &lt; 0.006) 11-dehydrocorticosterone ( p &lt; 0.001) as well as cortisol:cortisone ( p &lt; 0.001). The presence of dehydroepiandrosterone was associated with 16-hydroxyprogesterone ( p &lt; 0.001), which was also significantly lower. Adrenal and gonadal steroid analysis showed unexpected steroid heterogeneity in normal young men. Testosterone constitutes 78% of the circulating free androgens with the 11-oxy androgens abundantly present in all participants significantly contributing 22%. In addition, a subset of men were identified with low circulating dehydroepiandrosterone who showed altered adrenal steroids with decreased glucocorticoids and decreased C11-oxy androgens. Analysis of the classical and 11-oxy androgens with the additional measurement of dehydroepiandrosterone and 16-hydroxyprogesterone may allow better diagnostic accuracy in androgen excess or deficiency.',\n",
       "   'Background Over 55,000 spinal operations are performed annually in the NHS. Effective postoperative analgesia facilitates early mobilisation and assists rehabilitation and hospital discharge, but is difficult to achieve with conventional, opioid-based, oral analgesia. The clinical and cost-effectiveness of two alternative techniques, namely intrathecal opioid and the more novel erector-spinae plane blockade, is unknown. The Pain Relief After Instrumented Spinal Surgery (PRAISE) trial aims to evaluate these techniques. Methods PRAISE is a multicentre, prospective, parallel group, patient-blinded, randomised trial, seeking to recruit 456 adult participants undergoing elective, posterior lumbar-instrumented spinal surgery from up to 25 NHS hospitals. Participants will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive (1) Usual Care with local wound infiltration, (2) Intrathecal Opioid plus Usual Care with local wound infiltration or (3) Erector Spinae Plane blockade plus Usual Care with no local wound infiltration. The primary outcome is pain on movement on a 100mm visual analogue scale at 24 hours post-surgery. Secondary outcomes include pain at rest, leg pain, quality of recovery (QoR-15), postoperative opioid consumption, time to mobilisation, length of hospital stay, health utility (EQ-5D-5L), adverse events and resource use. Parallel economic evaluation will estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results Differences in the primary outcome at 24 hours will be estimated by mixed-effects linear regression modelling, with fixed effects for randomisation factors and other important prognostic variables, and random effects for centre, using the as-randomised population. Treatment effects with 95% confidence intervals will be presented. Conclusion The study is due to open in May 2024 and complete in 2026.

       "   \"This study evaluates the effectiveness of the UK’s AMR Strategy 2019-2024 in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), focusing on pharmaceutical innovations. By analyzing trends in human and veterinary antibiotic use alongside resistance rates, the research identifies improvements in reducing antibiotic consumption and resistance, with MRSA resistance declining from 10% in 2016 to 6% in 2023. Despite these positive trends, the research highlights ongoing challenges in the development and implementation of new antibiotics and alternative therapies. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, including policymakers and pharmaceutical experts, reveal barriers such as regulatory issues, slow innovation, and insufficient funding for new drug development. The study also examines case studies of pharmaceutical innovations, including β-lactamase inhibitors, bacteriophage therapies, and antimicrobial peptides, noting progress in some areas, but significant gaps in others. The research concludes that while the UK’s AMR Strategy has led to some positive outcomes, further efforts are needed to accelerate the development of novel therapies and address structural barriers in the pharmaceutical sector. Future research should focus on enhancing international collaboration, improving regulatory frameworks, and incentivizing innovation to combat AMR more effectively. Comparative analysis with other countries' strategies could also provide valuable insights for improving the UK’s response to the AMR crisis.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Feeling in control of one’s actions is fundamental to the formation of action-outcome relationships. Reinforcement and its valence also change the action-outcome relationship, either through behavior promotion or diminishment. In this study we evaluated how reward and punishment reinforcement modulate sense of agency, as measured by intentional binding. Moreover, using electroencephalography (EEG) we evaluated how reward and punishment reinforcement changes outcome event related potentials associated with the accuracy of participants’ judgement of the time interval between a key press and audio tone. We found that punishment reinforcement increased intentional binding between the action and outcome more than reward and control feedback. This was also reflected in the outcome event related potentials, where punishment elicited greater P300s and Late Positive Potentials compared to reward and control. We also found increased N100s and diminished P300s and Late Positive Potentials when the participants did not actively participate in evoking the tone. Taken together, our findings showcase that punishment reinforcement boosts sense of agency and modulates associated neural activity more than reward and no reinforcement, as a function of increasing attention and arousal. These findings illuminate the greater effect punishment reinforcement has on behavior and brain activity by its modification of sense of agency, which is important for the development of treatments in psychiatric and neurological diseases.'],\n",

Three laboratory experiments will be developed, creating a laboratory component to an existing power systems protection course. The laboratory coursework development is part of the Cal Poly electrical engineering department's Advanced Power Systems Initiatives which aim to modernize power engineering curriculum to more effectively educate power students and prepare them for the rapidly changing power industry. The experiments will focus on auto-synchronization of synchronous generators to the utility, standard generator protection, and load shedding while the system is islanded. Using automation and control techniques, students will have the opportunity to learn various power system protection schemes, as well as familiarize themselves with the communication and coordination of recently donated industry-standard power system protection equipment. Learning outcomes are formulated based on the desirable skills students should attain from each subsystem or components that make up the microgrid system. This includes for examples relay programming, oscillogram interpretation, and setting up the proper transformer connection. Further detailed descriptions of the three experiments along with their learning outcomes and assessment methods will be presented in this paper. Initial results of testing the experiments will also be described, along with challenges and lessons learned in the development of the laboratory coursework.\"],\n",

       "   'Trauma exposure poses a risk for diagnoses beyond trauma and stressor-related disorders listed in current psychological taxonomies. Alternative models, such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, posit that psychological phenomena are better organized in a hierarchical manner, with broader dimensions accounting for the covariation among lower order syndromes. Thus, the present study investigated the relationships between trauma exposure and internalizing syndromes through higher order psychological dimensions. Undergraduates (N = 585) at a large midwestern university completed questionnaires, which included the Life Events Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), the Inventory for Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (2nd ed.), and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Three structural equation models with stressors congruent and incongruent with Criterion A listed as predictors were used to examine the total, indirect, and direct effects for all internalizing indicators and first-order factors. After accounting for higher order dimensions, only insomnia and panic maintained a unique portion of variance explained by trauma variety. Trauma variety and interpersonal index traumas explained unique proportions of posttraumatic stress symptoms, but not distress or fear. Findings support the utility of assessing stressors through shared mechanisms within a hierarchical framework and substantiate trauma-induced insomnia theories through a novel relationship between trauma variety and insomnia.

       "   'Abstract Background The occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a traumatic event is associated with biological differences that can represent the susceptibility to PTSD, the impact of trauma, or the sequelae of PTSD itself. These effects include differences in DNA methylation (DNAm), an important form of epigenetic gene regulation, at multiple CpG loci across the genome. Moreover, these effects can be shared or specific to both central and peripheral tissues. Here, we aim to identify blood DNAm differences associated with PTSD and characterize the underlying biological mechanisms by examining the extent to which they mirror associations across multiple brain regions. Methods As the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) PTSD Epigenetics Workgroup, we conducted the largest cross-sectional meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of PTSD to date, involving 5077 participants (2156 PTSD cases and 2921 trauma-exposed controls) from 23 civilian and military studies. PTSD diagnosis assessments were harmonized following the standardized guidelines established by the PGC-PTSD Workgroup. DNAm was assayed from blood using either Illumina HumanMethylation450 or MethylationEPIC (850K) BeadChips. A common QC pipeline was applied. Within each cohort, DNA methylation was regressed on PTSD, sex (if applicable), age, blood cell proportions, and ancestry. An inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis was performed. We conducted replication analyses in tissue from multiple brain regions, neuronal nuclei, and a cellular model of prolonged stress. Results We identified 11 CpG sites associated with PTSD in the overall meta-analysis (1.44e-09 &lt; p &lt; 5.30e-08), as well as 14 associated in analyses of specific strata (military vs civilian cohort, sex, and ancestry), including CpGs in AHRR and CDC42BPB . Many of these loci exhibit blood-brain correlation in methylation levels and cross-tissue associations with PTSD in multiple brain regions. Methylation at most CpGs correlated with their annotated gene expression levels. Conclusions This study identifies 11 PTSD-associated CpGs, also leverages data from postmortem brain samples, GWAS, and genome-wide expression data to interpret the biology underlying these associations and prioritize genes whose regulation differs in those with PTSD.',\n",
       "   'Background: Childhood emotional abuse has been found to be significantly associated with exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs). One potential intervention for individuals exposed to childhood adverse and PMIEs is self-compassion. Objective: Explore the interplay between exposure to PMIEs, child emotional abuse and neglect, and self-compassion.Participants and Setting: 454 undergraduates at a midwestern university.Methods: Latent profile analysis was conducted to determine the optimal number of PMIE profiles. Multinomial logistic regression was run with posterior profile membership probabilities regressed on emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and self-compassion. Results: A three-profile (Low PMIE, Witness/Betrayal, High PMIE) model was identified. Compared to the High PMIEprofile, participants in the Witness/Betrayal profile were more likely to have higher self-compassion scores (OR = 1.052, 95% CI = 1.014–1.092, p = .006) and those in the Low PMIE profile were more likely to report lower emotional abuse (OR = .846, 95% CI = .791–.904, p < .001), lower emotional neglect (OR = .946, 95% CI = .898–.996, p = .036), and higher self-compassion (OR = 1.100, 95% CI = 1.057–1.145, p < .001). Compared to the Low PMIE profile, those in the Witness/Betrayal profile were more likely to have greater emotional abuse (OR = 1.174, 95% CI = 1.097–1.256, p < .001) and less self-compassion (OR = .956, 95% CI = .920–.995, p = .027).Conclusions: These findings contribute to the existing moral injury and childhood adversity literature and highlight self-compassion as an area of intervention.',\n",

       "   'In this article, the authors examine the idea of social and emotional learning (SEL) and discuss ways it can contribute to a favorable future for physical education. While physical education has a long history and best practices aligned with this initiative, there is certainly room to improve. Not only can practitioners be more intentional and explicit in the ways SEL is promoted, a favorable future for physical education would involve a transformative approach that helps students develop SEL skills while also addressing institutional and systemic barriers that limit opportunities for social and emotional development. As the authors explain, transformative SEL in physical education would be characterized by student empowerment, culturally responsive teaching, and students applying these lessons in other settings for the betterment of themselves and society. The article concludes with a discussion of what it would take to move in this direction with regard to theory, policy, research, and practice.',\n",

       "   'Expectations for and rates of scholarly productivity have increased substantively across academic fields, including physical education and sport pedagogy. Concurrent with higher scholarly output has been an increase in collaborative, team approaches to science and fewer sole authored publications. This has led to the development and propagation of different types of intra- and trans-institutional research arrangements. While research laboratories are traditionally associated with the natural or hard sciences, social science researchers can also develop meaningful and collaborative spaces. This can be the case even in environments with limited faculty affiliates or graduate students or minimal or marginal physical space. The purpose of this paper is to overview examples of intra-institutional arrangements that promote scholarship and education while collaborating with outside groups. We ground the conversation in sense of community theory and key tenets of collaboration. Four intra-institutional collaborative groups are overviewed and discussed as illustrative examples and linked to best practices in collaboration. More specifically, we highlight connections to the four components of SoC (i.e. membership, influence, integration of needs, shared emotional connection), highlight the teaching and learning mission of each unit, connect to four pillars of collaborative work (i.e. shared purpose, ethic of contribution, development of independent processes, value and reward collaboration), and highlight trans-institutional collaborations with other researchers and groups. We conclude with encouragement for others to use the examples provided as inspiration for creating or further developing collaborative scholarly groups.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The availability of environmental nutrients is an existential constraint for heterotrophic organisms and is thus expected to impact numerous biochemical and physiological features. The continuously proliferative polyp stage of colonial hydroids provides a useful model to study these features, allowing genetically identical replicates to be compared. Two groups of colonies of Eirene sp., defined by different feeding treatments, were grown by explanting the same founder colony onto cover glass. Colonies of both treatments were allowed to grow continuously by explanting them onto new cover glass as they reached the edge of the existing surface. The nutrient-abundant polyps grew faster and produced more clumped or \"sheet-like\" colonies. Compared to the founder colony, the nutrient-abundant colonies exhibited more mutations (i.e., single-nucleotide polymorphisms) than the nutrient-scarce colonies. Nevertheless, these differences were not commensurate with the differences in growth. Using a polarographic electrode, we found that the nutrient-abundant colonies exhibited lower rates of oxygen uptake relative to total protein. The probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and fluorescent microscopy allowed visualization of the mitochondrion-rich cells at the base of the polyps and showed that the nutrient-abundant colonies exhibited greater amounts of reactive oxygen species than the nutrient-scarce colonies. Parallels to the Warburg effect—aerobic glycolysis, diminished oxygen uptake, and lactate secretion—found in human cancers and other proliferative cells may be suggested. However, little is known about anaerobic metabolism in cnidarians. Examination of oxygen uptake suggests an anaerobic threshold at a roughly 1-mg/L oxygen concentration. Nutrient-abundant colonies may respond more dramatically to this threshold than nutrient-scarce colonies.'],\n",

In the NIRCam images, we identify: (1) faint H2 crescents, which are emissions located between the ejecta and the equatorial ring, (2) a bar, which is a substructure of the ejecta, and (3) the bright 3–5 $\\\\mu$m continuum emission exterior to the equatorial ring. The emission of the remnant in the NIRCam 1–2.3 $\\\\mu$m images is mostly due to line emission, which is mostly emitted in the ejecta and in the hotspots within the equatorial ring. In contrast, the NIRCam 3–5 $\\\\mu$m images are dominated by continuum emission. In the ejecta, the continuum is due to dust, obscuring the centre of the ejecta. In contrast, in the ring and exterior to the ring, synchrotron emission contributes a substantial fraction to the continuum. Dust emission contributes to the continuum at outer spots and diffuse emission exterior to the ring, but little within the ring. This shows that dust cooling and destruction time-scales are shorter than the synchrotron cooling time-scale, and the time-scale of hydrogen recombination in the ring is even longer than the synchrotron cooling time-scale. With the advent of high sensitivity and high angular resolution images provided by JWST/NIRCam, our observations of SN 1987A demonstrate that NIRCam opens up a window to study particle-acceleration and shock physics in unprecedented details, probed by near-infrared synchrotron emission, building a precise picture of how an SN evolves.',\n",
       "   'Abstract The motion of systems with linear restoring forces and recurring nonlinear perturbations is of central importance in physics. When a system’s natural oscillation frequencies and the frequency of the nonlinear restoring forces satisfy certain algebraic relations, the dynamics become resonant. In accelerator physics, an understanding of resonances and nonlinear dynamics is crucial for avoiding the loss of beam particles. Here we confirm the theoretical prediction of the dynamics for a single two-dimensional coupled resonance by observing so-called fixed lines. Specifically, we use the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron to measure the position of a particle beam at discrete locations around the accelerator. These measurements allow us to construct the Poincaré surface of section, which captures the main features of the dynamics in a periodic system. In our setting, any resonant particle passing through the Poincaré surface of section lies on a curve embedded in a four-dimensional phase space, the fixed line. These findings are relevant for mitigating beam degradation and thus for achieving high-intensity and high-brightness beams, as required for both current and future accelerator projects.',\n",
       "   'Abstract We present JWST NIRCam (F356W and F444W filters) and MIRI (F770W) images and NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy of the young Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A) to probe the physical conditions for molecular CO formation and destruction in supernova ejecta. We obtained the data as part of a JWST survey of Cas A. The NIRCam and MIRI images map the spatial distributions of synchrotron radiation, Ar-rich ejecta, and CO on both large and small scales, revealing remarkably complex structures. The CO emission is stronger at the outer layers than the Ar ejecta, which indicates the re-formation of CO molecules behind the reverse shock. NIRSpec-IFU spectra (3–5.5 μ m) were obtained toward two representative knots in the NE and S fields that show very different nucleosynthesis characteristics. Both regions are dominated by the bright fundamental rovibrational band of CO in the two R and P branches, with strong [Ar vi ] and relatively weaker, variable strength ejecta lines of [Si ix ], [Ca iv ], [Ca v ], and [Mg iv ]. The NIRSpec-IFU data resolve individual ejecta knots and filaments spatially and in velocity space. The fundamental CO band in the JWST spectra reveals unique shapes of CO, showing a few tens of sinusoidal patterns of rovibrational lines with pseudocontinuum underneath, which is attributed to the high-velocity widths of CO lines. Our results with LTE modeling of CO emission indicate a temperature of ∼1080 K and provide unique insight into the correlations between dust, molecules, and highly ionized ejecta in supernovae and have strong ramifications for modeling dust formation that is led by CO cooling in the early Universe.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['In this chapter we present a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code that is developed in Julia programming language customized for efficient electromagnetic simulation of microstrip circuits. Julia language has become popular in recent years for developing codes for scientific computing due to high-performance it can provide while being a dynamically typed language that supports interactive use like MATLAB or Python. The presented FDTD program is customized for faster simulation of microstrip circuits with lower memory requirements by employing an efficient form of FDTD updating equations, referred to as edge-length normalized formulation, as well as other simplifications that would make it sufficient to analyze single layer microstrip circuits and produce scattering parameters. We demonstrate how updating equations for fields, sources, and absorbing boundaries are modified to accommodate edge-length normalization, and how these equations are translated into a code in Julia. We then conclude the chapter with a presentation of some examples of circuits simulated with the presented code.',\n",
       "   'This paper proposes a scalable architecture for predicting antenna performance using various data-informed machine learning (DIML) methods. By utilizing the computation power of graphics processing units (GPUs), the architecture takes advantage of hardware (HW) acceleration from the beginning of electromagnetic (EM) full-wave simulation to the final machine learning (ML) validation. A total of 49152 full-wave simulations of a classical microwave patch antenna forms the ML dataset. The dataset contains the performance of patch antenna on six commonly used materials and two standard thicknesses in a wide frequency range from 0.1 to 20 GHz. A total of 13 base ML models are stacked and ensembled in a tabular workflow with performance as 0.970 and 0.933 F1 scores for two classification models, as well as 0.912 and 0.819 R2 scores for two regression models. Moreover, an image-based workflow is proposed. The image-based workflow yields the 0.823 R2 score, indicating a near real-time prediction for all S11 values from 0.1 to 20 GHz. The proposed architecture requires neither the fine-tuned hyperparameters in the ML-assisted optimization (MLAO) model for specified antenna design nor the pre-knowledge required in the physics-informed models. The fully automated process with data collection and the customized ML pipeline provides the architecture with robust scalability in future work where more antenna types, materials, and performance requirements can be involved. Also, it could be wrapped as a pre-trained ML model as a reference for other antenna designs.',\n",

Methodologists have increasing choices for such assessments, including a growing array of digital images for rating scales and increasingly cost-effective handheld mechanical devices based on color science. Guidance is needed for choosing among these growing options. We used data from a diverse sample of 102 college students to produce new empirical evidence and practical guidance about various options. We compared three handheld devices that ranged in price, considering variations in their reliabilities and how their results differed by where on the body and with what device settings readings were taken. We also offered evidence regarding how reliably interviewers and participants could choose from a large array of color swatches offering variation in skin undertone (redness, yellowness) in addition to skin shade (lightness-to-darkness). Overall, the results were promising, demonstrating that modern handheld devices and rating scales could be feasibly and reliably used. For instance, results demonstrated that just one or two device readings were needed at any given location, and, the device readings and rating scale scores similarly captured the relative darkness of skin. In other cases, recommendations were less certain. For instance, skin undertones of redness and yellowness were more sensitive to device choices and body locations. We encourage future studies that pursue why such variability exists and for which substantive questions it matters most.',\n",

       "   'This study explores how observed emotion-focused teaching in preschool classrooms differs across classroom activity settings. Forty-three teachers were observed across several mornings. A total of 1,604 video cycles were coded for levels of emotion-focused teaching (e.g., total, modeling, responding, and instructing) and their activity settings (e.g., mealtimes and transition). Activity settings seemed to afford—to varying degrees for different teachers—the opportunity to interact with children around their emotional learning. Small-group activity settings had the highest levels of emotion-focused teaching, and mealtimes had the lowest. Emotion instructing occurred most often during whole-group interactions, and emotion modeling occurred most often during children’s independent work. Findings can inform the creation and implementation of professional development to promote these emotion-focused teaching practices. While research is increasingly demonstrating the value of emotion-focused teaching, understanding the variability of such practice over the various activity settings may identify opportunities to enhance the intentional support of children’s emotional learning.'],\n",

       "   'Physical function is regarded as the cornerstone of healthy aging, and exercise is an important determinant of healthy aging. This study examined the feasibility and physiological (heart rate, blood pressure, blood lactate, and rate of perceived exertion) and psychological (enjoyment) response resulting from an acute progressive sled-push (SLP) exercise session using the novel XPO Sled Trainer in older adults and compared that with walking (WKC) condition. The exercise session comprised six exercise bouts at 75%, 85%, 100% (2×), and 125% (2×) of normal velocity with a 2-min rest between bouts. Thirty-six older adults were randomly allocated into either the SLP or WKC conditions. No adverse events were observed during the exercise session, and all participants completed the exercise protocol as prescribed. One-third of the participants in the SLP group reported minimal body discomfort. Significantly higher responses were observed for all physiological variables as the intensity of the exercise increased in the SLP group compared with the WKC group ( p &lt; .001). The SLP group presented a decline in enjoyment as the intensity of the exercise increased (during), but similar enjoyment level than the WKC group for the overall exercise session ( p = .711). Our findings support the viability and safety of SLP exercise using the XPO Sled Trainer in older adults. Such exercise demonstrated an intensity-driven modality that may have potential to elucidate positive adaptations in the cardiovascular system of older adults with acceptable levels of enjoyment.',\n",
       "   'Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) impacts 50% of U.S. adults although few studies evaluate young adults’ cardiovascular disease risk. Early identification of cardiovascular disease risk may mitigate increased adulthood incidence. We analyzed (CVD) risk factors and their association with cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text] o 2 max) to devise effective strategies to improve cardiovascular health across the lifespan. Methods A cross-sectional study evaluated the effect of a single bout of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular disease risk factors in adults aged 18 to 36 years. Glycemic control (HbA 1C ), cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text]o 2 max), percent body fat, lean body mass, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. Results Statistically significant relationships were observed between percent body fat (r = .83, P &lt; .001) and BMI, and waist circumference (r = .83, P &lt; .001) and BMI. Percent body fat ( P &lt; .001) and race ( P = .018) predicted exercise time, with Asians exercising the longest. Percent fat ( P &lt; .001) and HbA 1C ( P = .039) were identified as predictors of cardiovascular fitness which was low in spite of primarily normal average HbA 1C levels. Conclusions HbA 1C and body fat negatively influence cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text] o 2 max) in young adults increasing adulthood cardiovascular disease risk. Research investigating the effect of HbA 1C on cardiovascular health especially in youth is warranted.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract The use of fused deposition modeling (FDM) in printing polymers for various applications has been ever increasing. However, its utilization in printing polymers for high-strength and superior surface finish applications is still a challenge, primarily due to process intrinsic defects, i.e., voids between the layers and the rough exterior arising from unrestrained deposition of molten polymer. This research hypothesizes that application of ultrasonic vibration (USV) post-fabrication could minimize these shortcomings. For this investigation, ASTM D638 Type IV samples were FDM-printed using poly(lactic) acid (PLA). Through screening experiments, an optimized set of ultrasonic parameters was determined. Then, the effect of both-sided ultrasonic application was characterized. Subsequently, the impact of USV on the samples’ physical, tensile, and morphological properties was examined by varying the layer height, infill patterns, and % infill density. Up to 70% roughness reduction was observed as a result of post-FDM ultrasonic application. Additionally, the tensile strength of the samples increased by up to 15.31%. Moreover, for some lower % infill samples, post-ultrasonic tensile strengths were higher than 100% infill control samples. Analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) imagery indicated enhanced layer consolidation and reduced void presence in samples treated with ultrasonic. The combination of ultrasonic-generated heat and downward pressure promoted a synergistic squeeze flow and intermolecular diffusion across consecutive layers of polymers. As a result, increased tensile strength and surface finish were achieved while dimensional change was marginal.',\n",

Coaches of youth 18 years and under, select Midwest state SRC laws, cross-section of athletic organizational policies and published concussion guidelines/position statements. Data was collected and analyzed using deductive and inductive qualitative analysis framed around the categories of education and training, removal from play and return to play. Methods for each data source varied based on the nature of the information reviewed. A comprehensive list of 44 elements relevant for youth coaches to strengthen sideline decisions (STRIDES) in recognition of SRC signs during sport. The STRIDES provides synthesized recommendations targeting content relevant to supporting coach recognition of SRC signs. The STRIDES is intended as a guide to develop or refine tools for effective implementation of evidence-based practices for sideline decision makers, such as coaches, who do not have medical professionals available at the time of decision-making. STRIDES is not intended to replace the medical professional but, rather, to support the knowledge and skills of coaches to recognize signs of SRC and make informed decisions about sport participation and referral to a medical professional.',\n",

       "   'More than one million Americans are estimated to participate in global health engagements (GHEs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) each year. A growing number of studies document perceptions of GHEs from the perspective of American and other high-income country (HIC) visitors traveling to LMICs, particularly regarding motivations and satisfaction relative to their participation in these activities. Far fewer studies examine perceptions of GHEs from the perspective of LMIC hosts and other local constituent groups. The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze studies that examined local stakeholder perspectives of global health engagements in LMICs around the world. We conducted a scoping review of PubMed and Google Scholar using the Population-Concept-Context (PCC) framework. Assessment and analysis of articles was conducted by a team of three reviewers (EA, FS, SB). A total of 31 relevant papers published between 2009 and 2021 provided local perspectives of GHEs, with participants falling into three stakeholder categories: providers of care, recipients of care, and community members. Analysis revealed that stakeholder groups often held complex and highly nuanced perspectives of GHEs, perceiving these activities as having both positive and negative implications in the host communities. Synthesis of the eligible studies&amp;rsquo; findings resulted in three thematic categories: resources and perceived benefits derived from GHEs; perceived challenges associated with GHEs; and opportunities for improvement of GHEs. To our knowledge, this scoping review is among the first to identify and collectively analyze LMIC stakeholder perceptions of GHEs. Recommendations for future research are provided.',\n",
       "   'The Association of Doctoral Programs in Health Sciences (ADPHS) was informally established in November 2019, officially incorporated in August 2021, and is currently a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization comprised of the directors of member doctoral programs of health sciences. The ADPHS grew from informal discussions among program directors who agreed that a major problem in the field of doctoral education in health sciences was the lack of a clearly defined and easily articulable identity. The discussions led to the drafting of an informal and nonscientific survey used to help clarify the current health sciences education environment, relevant emerging trends, and the educational philosophies adopted by the directors of health sciences doctoral programs nationally. The results of the survey and follow-up discussions revealed a strong consensus among program directors that the field of doctorate education in health sciences is uniformly characterized by its interdisciplinary nature. In this position paper, we provide the rationale for the formal position of the ADPHS that the identity of the field of doctoral education in health sciences is based on its interdisciplinary approach to education.',\n",

       "   \"Teamwork skills across disciplines are increasingly required for delivery of quality health care. To meet this expectation, healthcare professionals, researchers, policymakers, and educators must embrace and employ the tenets associated with teamwork. In addition, health professions faculty are expected to prepare entry-level professionals for interprofessional practice and scholarship. While various strategies reported in the literature document how entry-level health science educational programs infuse and assess the impact of interprofessional education experiences, less emphasis has been placed on understanding how faculty prepare to take on this role. Traditional doctoral education has been offered as a discipline-specific, silo-based learning experience that provides an in-depth analysis into a specific content area of interest. With the expanding emphasis on interprofessional practice in health care, an interprofessional forward-thinking approach to graduate education at the doctoral level emerged, the health science doctorate. This commentary paper seeks to describe the health scientist's identity as a scholar-practitioner who supports and advances interprofessional education and practice. Doctoral-prepared health scientists act as knowledge brokers, translators, and change agents, exemplifying interprofessional research and communication skills. Faculty need to prepare students to explain complex concepts, engage in clinical reasoning, and decision-making, and employ observational and data analysis to improve health professions education and ultimately team-based care.\"],\n",

       "   'Athletic trainers often find themselves immersed in organizations that can critically influence the way in which they fulfill their professional obligations. The workplace can offer many situations that are challenging, particularly for those athletic trainers who are transitioning into clinical practice. With that in mind, Workplace Concepts for Athletic Trainers provides readers with clear and meaningful information that addresses common concepts and issues that occur in the workplace. The topics selected are a reflection of those covered in the literature as problematic yet identifiable and manageable.

Objective: Investigate FIWC among collegiate athletic trainers. Specifically, we were focused on relationships between gender, marital status, employment status of the athletic trainer’s spouse, and number of children. Methods: Data were collected via a cross-sectional, online survey (Qualtrics). Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic information; Mann Whitney U analyses were utilized to discover differences between gender, marital status, employment status of spouse, and number of children. Results: 984 (605 women, 370 men, 9 other) collegiate athletic trainers. Cronbach’s alpha resulted in acceptable reliability of the WIFC (.92), the FIWC (.86), and the total WFC scale (.84). Women reported significantly higher FIWC scores than men (U=93539.5, pConclusions: Women athletic trainers reported higher levels of FIWC than men. We found both single and married with children athletic trainers report high levels of FIWC, suggesting both groups experience the challenges of family demands. Interestingly, children did not impact experiences of FIWC.'],\n",

The computational generation of these data from quantum chemistry requires a time-efficient method capable of capturing the essential physics. One such method, fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) (using single Slater–Jastrow trial wavefunctions), has demonstrated the capability to recover 90%–95% of missing dynamic correlation energy for typical systems. In this study, methyl radical addition to ethylene serves as a simple model to test FN-DMC’s ability to calculate enthalpies of reaction and activation energies with different time steps, antisymmetric trial wavefunctions, basis set sizes, and effective core potentials. The FN-DMC computational protocol thus defined for methyl radical addition to ethylene is subsequently benchmarked against Weizmann-1 and experimental reaction enthalpies from Lin et al.’s test set of 21 radical addition and 28 hydrogen abstraction enthalpies. Our findings reveal that FN-DMC consistently generates reaction enthalpies with chemical accuracy, exhibiting mean absolute deviation of 3.5(7) and 1.4(8) kJ/mol from the Weizmann-1 reference for radical addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions, respectively. Given its favorable computational scaling and high degree of parallelizability, we, therefore, recommend more comprehensive testing of FN-DMC with effective core potentials to address more extensive and intricate polymerization reactions and reactions with other radicals.',\n",

Its long-baseline configuration will exploit a Near Detector (ND) and a Far Detector (FD) located at a distance of ∼1300 km. The FD will consist of four Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) modules. A Photon Detection System (PDS) will be used to detect the scintillation light produced inside the detector after neutrino interactions. The PDS will be based on light collectors coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). Different photosensor technologies have been proposed and produced in order to identify the best samples to fullfill the experiment requirements. In this paper, we present the procedure and results of a validation campaign for the Hole Wire Bonding (HWB) MPPCs samples produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) for the DUNE experiment, referring to them as `SiPMs'. The protocol for a characterization at cryogenic temperature (77 K) is reported. We present the down-selection criteria and the results obtained during the selection campaign undertaken, along with a study of the main sources of noise of the SiPMs including the investigation of a newly observed phenomenon in this field.\",\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Controlled polymerization for the synthesis of structurally precise conjugated polymers remains a challenging problem in polymer chemistry. Catalyst-transfer polymerization (CTP) based on Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling is one of the promising approaches toward solving this challenge. Recent introduction of N-methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates as monomers for Suzuki–Miyaura CTP has extended this approach toward a broader variety of monomer structures and led to improved control over the polymerization, particularly for heteroaromatic systems (such as thiophenes). Previously, we found that MIDA boronate monomer polymerization could be facilitated by Ag+-mediated reaction conditions due to shifting the Pd catalytic cycle toward a more efficient oxo-Pd transmetalation pathway where MIDA boronates could participate in transmetalation directly without prior hydrolysis to boronic acid. In this work, we continued studying this novel process and investigated the dual role of the MIDA boronate functional group in the case of less reactive fluorenyl (and potentially other all-carbon aromatic systems) monomers. With such monomers, the MIDA boronate group enables the controlled polymerization but also produces a hydrolysis byproduct, hindering the polymerization. We also investigated the role of Ag+ in counteracting this hindering effect. Steric bulkiness of the MIDA boronate functional group may also slow down the Suzuki–Miyaura CTP process. These complications could reduce the synthetic value of MIDA boronate monomers in Suzuki–Miyaura CTP, although better understanding of these implications and a proper choice of polymerization conditions and catalytic initiators could to some extent mitigate such problems. As part of this work, we also uncovered a \"critical length\" phenomenon, which results in a dual molecular weight distribution of the resulting conjugated polymer, both with MIDA boronate and boronic acid monomers. This phenomenon could account for the experimentally observed loss of polymerization control beyond formation of the polymer chains of a certain \"critical length\", even despite the formally \"living\" nature of the polymer chains. The generality of this phenomenon and whether it is restricted to using Pd catalytic systems based on Buchwald-type phosphine ligands remain to be studied. Overall, these new findings paint a sophisticated picture of the Suzuki–Miyaura CTP process with MIDA boronate monomers where the mere presence of a Pd center on the polymer chain is not sufficient to sustain the polymerization (even if a chain could be considered \"living\" in the sense of possessing a Pd center), and the choice of the phosphine ligand on the Pd center is an effective tool to overcome the \"critical length\" restriction.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Over the past 50 years, a principal approach to controlling conventional photochemical reactions has relied on imposing geometric constraints on reactant or transition state via conducting photochemistry in the organized or constraining media. Herein, we describe a fundamentally different approach to affect the course of photochemical reactions (photochemical rearrangements) by utilizing spatially selective excitation of specific electronic transitions with plane‐polarized light in the reactant molecules uniformly aligned in the nematic liquid crystal phase. In particular, we focused on the Type B enone rearrangement of 4,4‐diarylcyclohexenones – one of the most common photochemical rearrangements. We demonstrated that the aryl migratory aptitude in this reaction was attenuated in response to changing an angle between the polarization plane of the incident light and the alignment direction of the nematic liquid crystal, with the enhanced aryl migration achieved when the polarization plane coincided with the transition dipole moment leading to the excited state responsible for this migration. The spatially‐selective initial excitation therefore was overruling the electronic factors responsible for the relative ratio of the two alternative photoproducts. The experimental findings were further supported by the results of a computational study. This work showcases a new fundamental paradigm in controlling photochemical reactivity and selectivity of photoreactions.',\n",
       "   'Thin films of poly(arylene ethynylene)-conjugated polymers, including low-energy-gap donor-acceptor polymers, can be prepared via stepwise polymerization utilizing surface-confined Sonogashira cross-coupling. This robust and efficient polymerization protocol yields conjugated polymers with a precise molecular structure and with nanometer-level control of the organization and the uniform alignment of the macromolecular chains in the densely packed film. In addition to high stability and predictable and well-defined molecular organization and morphology, the surface-confined conjugated polymer chains experience significant interchain electronic interactions, resulting in dominating intermolecular π-electron delocalization which is primarily responsible for the electronic and spectroscopic properties of polymer films. The fluorescent films demonstrate remarkable performance in chemosensing applications, showing a turn-off fluorescent response on the sub-ppt (part per trillion) level of nitroaromatic explosives in water. This unique sensitivity is likely related to the enhanced exciton mobility in the uniformly aligned and structurally monodisperse polymer films.'],\n",

       "   \"In 1897 the renowned muckraking journalist and progressive novelist, Bolesław Prus, published a series of editorials in the Warsaw press criticizing the treatment of poor young women traveling on their own. Single females on the move, he claimed, whether on city streets or in third-class train compartments, were subject to persistent harassment, groping, and worse from male passengers. Prus wrote of shabbily dressed travellers forced to jump from moving trains or duck into alleyways to avoid being accosted as presumed prostitutes. Prus's concern about the treatment of lower-class women is but one reflection of the fraught social relations that characterized early twentieth-century Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and conditioned attitudes toward female sexuality. By the turn of the twentieth century, assumptions regarding the sexual vulnerability of working-class females prompted an extended moral panic about the dangers that awaited all women while venturing into public spaces. Families of young women who failed to turn up at their intended destinations increasingly reported them to local police as likely victims of sex traffickers. Even when the daughters later resurfaced, the presumption often remained that they had been coerced into the sex trade and permanently fallen from grace.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract Keystone species are critical to maintaining ecological relationships and ecosystem functioning around the world. Prairie dogs ( Cynomys sp.) are a genus of colonial keystone species endemic to North American grasslands that modify bird community composition via ecological disturbance, but this topic has not been reviewed despite many studies on grassland bird associations with prairie dogs. We conducted a systematic literature review ( n = 111 studies) where we assessed three hypotheses and found consistent support for each: (1) prairie dogs increase abundance of early‐successional grassland birds through grazing, (2) prairie dog towns modify bird community composition compared to nearby grassland because they increase heterogeneity within grasslands at large spatial scales, and (3) prairie dogs increase raptor abundance by serving as a prey base. Significant gaps in our understanding of the effects of prairie dogs on birds remain. Most research was conducted on black‐tailed prairie dogs during the bird breeding season and focused on how prairie dogs modify the occurrence and abundance of birds. Research is needed on the effects of other prairie dog species, effects on birds during the non‐breeding or migratory seasons, and effects on demography, particularly for songbirds. Continued work on this topic can increase our understanding of how keystone species affect bird communities and inform conservation of grassland birds globally. Due to rapid declines of grassland birds in North America, we suggest conserving prairie dog towns as vital sources of early successional grassland and habitat heterogeneity.',\n",

       "   \"In 1915, 2 years after the British Ecological Society (BES) was formed, ecologists in the United States followed suit and formed the Ecological Society of America (ESA). At the outset, there was unrest. One faction thought the Society should focus solely on research, while another thought activism to protect natural areas was important. In 1917, some in the activist wing formed the Committee on the Preservation of Natural Areas, but in 1946, the ESA disbanded the committee to focus solely on its research mission. The activists then launched the Ecologists' Union, an organization outside the ESA devoted to the protection of ecosystems, and in 1950, the Union was renamed The Nature Conservancy. And so it went that a giant in the field of nature protection was born out of a small number of activists who could not gain traction for their activism within their chosen professional home. When our Ecological Solutions and Evidence (ESE) team brainstormed some big ideas in ecology we wanted to cover in this year's editorial, we discussed the real-world impacts achieved by the manuscripts published in ESE, ways in which our work could meaningfully engage communities to care about ecosystem well-being, and how we could increase stakeholder participation and promote other types of social engagement in solution-oriented ecological work. In the end, we realized that these topics are interconnected, and, a little over 100 years after the kerfuffle between pure-research and activist-minded scientists at ESA began, our team is still grappling with this question: What are the responsibilities of ecologists to society that extend beyond the merits of pure research? The stark contrast between science and activism that birthed The Nature Conservancy is still ever-present but in some ways, barely a glimmer in ecology today. Some academic departments still do not recognize efforts to affect societal change as meritorious for tenure and promotion, and others implicitly or explicitly discourage faculty from engaging in those activities and may avoid hiring faculty who do (Djupe et al., 2017; Eliason, 2023; Friedline et al., 2023; Sdvizhkov et al., 2022; Uriarte et al., 2007). For example, just last year, two prominent Earth scientists were reprimanded by their academic organization (the American Geophysical Union, AGU) and one was subsequently fired from her US government job for their minute-long climate change protest at AGU's annual academic conference (Valero, 2023). While that may seem chilling to ecologists who feel we have a duty to speak out for change in the context of the twin biodiversity and climate crises, the landscape is changing for the better. Universities are increasingly encouraging and facilitating interaction with the general public to broaden education on ecological topics (Benneworth, 2012; Benneworth et al., 2008; McDowell, 2001), incorporating statements supporting this wider engagement into their missions (Beere et al., 2011; Torres-Harding et al., 2015; Velcoff & Ferrari, 2006), and scholars are increasingly focussed on how to best facilitate faculty social engagement on environmentally relevant issues (O'Meara & Jaeger, 2019; Rhoades, 2012; Surak & Pope, 2016). We thus contend that since the BES and ESA were formed, we have gone through Holling and Gunderson's adaptive cycle—wherein following the collapse of a system, the system is reorganized and generally improved (Holling & Gunderson, 2002)—and come out the other side with a more robust, inclusive and socially relevant ecology. One does not have to look far to see that ecologists' perceptions of what they can contribute to society beyond their research objectives have changed through time. At the recent BES annual conference in December 2023, themes on inclusivity, co-designing research with practitioners and balancing science with activism ran throughout the program. Our recent special feature, in which the BES teamed up with the Society for Ecological Restoration to cover topics regarding the U.N. Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, illustrated a groundswell of support for increasing inclusive stakeholder engagement, calling for multidisciplinary teams and policy interventions and recognizing and integrating the knowledge and skills of Indigenous people into restoration science (Jones & Murphy, 2023). The presence and growing support for journals such as ESE—journals with mandates to publish management and conservation-relevant science—illustrate that many ecologists have moved beyond the realm of only producing science to actively applying their work to solving relevant global problems. In many ways, academic journals have a parallel divide between what is published and the wider influence of those publications. Journals such as ESE seek to publish science that supports the management of species and ecosystems, with less concern about impact on author indices. For example, when we received our first impact factor this year (2.9), our editorial team was excited, but the conversation immediately turned to questions of the 'real' sway achieved by our published articles, meaning, did the articles published in ESE actually contribute to management and conservation solutions? To measure that, we polled authors who published in ESE between February 2022 and March 2023 to ask what the authors hoped their impact would be and what they perceived it actually was (Figure 1). Of the 17 lead authors who responded, 94% stated they hoped their research results would inform people beyond their academic peers including the public, policymakers, practitioners and local communities. Over half the authors (59%) said they wanted policymakers to use their results for better ecological outcomes, and over a third (35%) sought to change management practices of the species or ecosystems they studied. In terms of what influence the work in ESE actually achieved, authors stated their work informed audiences beyond their academic peers (76%), policymakers using their research (35%), and said that management strategies of their study species or ecosystem changed as a result of their work (18%). Authors also stated that their ESE publications sparked conversations with managers, students and the public about their research topics, and inspired others to take similar management approaches. These are exactly the types of impacts we are excited about in that they extend beyond simply reporting the science and serve society by contributing meaningfully to better management of species and ecosystems in the face of extreme human pressures. Despite the demonstration of meaningful output scientists can contribute beyond academia, there are legitimate concerns from science and society about scientist social engagement, which we define as activities beyond pure science along a spectrum that can include outreach and working with stakeholders for change, all the way up to true activism. Many scientists express uncertainty about how best to balance conducting science with promoting relevant social engagement. One way academics might overcome this is to use faculty governance to push for changing departmental, college- and university-level governing documents to value such work and/or ensure no repercussions for it. In terms of balancing science and social engagement, being honest and transparent about your point of view, values, and societal objectives to audiences and stakeholders can be a good first step. This can help researchers frame their research interests and questions transparently and ensure others understand their motivations. For example, we senior editors at ESE are all motivated to pursue research that has direct applications for stemming biodiversity loss for ethical and pragmatic reasons. Recognizing that motivation as a driving force in our science does not preclude us from following the scientific method just as would any other scientist without those motivations, but it does improve stakeholder and public trust if we are transparent about our motivations from the start. Clearly stating project goals upfront is another important step. Often, there will be stated science goals and stated outreach/broader impacts goals; both should specifically declare the target audience for the research. It is critical that scientists engage all relevant stakeholders, and especially their target audience, early and often throughout their research. For example, too many scientists tout the importance of their work to ecosystem management without having talked to an ecosystem manager before, during or after their research. This can result in research that is disconnected from management needs and thus not applicable in the way the scientist had hoped. Although it can be difficult, ecologists who manage to successfully navigate the potentially tricky landscape and incorporate social engagement into their non-research activities find fulfilment and impact in their work. Much of the shift to a more inclusive and socially responsive ecology is a product of necessity—as our climate warms at rates never before encountered and as we lose species faster than ever, who better than those studying these phenomena to raise the alarm to non-scientists? As anthropogenic pressures on Earth's social–ecological systems mount, many ecologists feel they no longer have the option of simply conducting excellent science. Instead, many are learning to work in multidisciplinary contexts to solve pressing environmental issues. They are training to effectively communicate to non-scientists and persuade the public. They are actively seeking out and/or building laboratories that pursue management-relevant science with immediate real-world applications. They are publishing in journals such as ESE that require the framing of research in a management context. We are excited to be part of this ongoing change in mindset; to meet this moment of Earth's dwindling resources and need for protection, we must raise our voices and advocate for a better future.

       "   'Abstract Ecological restoration is a crucial tool for mitigating climate change and addressing the global biodiversity crisis. The extensive knowledge of Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) will play a key role in accelerating the advancement of restoration efforts but has historically been excluded. BIPOC traditions and practices of protecting and restoring ecological communities include intricate socio‐ecological systems whose holistic practices preserve cultural knowledge while simultaneously addressing environmental issues. If we are to have a seat at the table for everyone and meet the lofty goals of the U.N. Decade on Ecosystem Restoration to contribute to reversing the biodiversity and climate crises, the field of restoration ecology can no longer afford to exclude BIPOC communities and their irreplaceable social, cultural, and ecological knowledge. Solution : We offer opportunities to engage BIPOC communities and their contributions to restoration, and to introduce a restoration community to connect and center BIPOC through the Black Earth Restoration Collective . This is a call to action to those with power and access in restoration ecology to make vital shifts needed to accomplish a more equitable and just approach to restoration.',\n",

       "   \"Abstract Grazing from megaherbivores such as bison ( Bison bison ) and periodic fire are 2 important disturbance regimes in grassland ecosystems. In restored tallgrass prairies where these processes were previously removed, prescribed fire application and bison reintroduction are tools used by managers to recreate habitat heterogeneity formed by these disturbances. Tallgrass prairie bird communities may be indirectly affected by these disturbances, as bison and prescribed fire alter the structure of critical breeding habitat for grassland birds. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of bison and prescribed fire on grassland breeding birds in 2 tallgrass prairie preserves in the Midwest region of the United States. We surveyed bird communities, vegetation structure, and bison activity at an Illinois preserve ( n = 20 sites) and an Indiana preserve ( n = 27 sites) in 2020 and 2021 and compiled a history of restoration activities (e.g., prescribed fire, planting year) at these sites. Grazing and fire disturbances affected grassland bird diversity and abundances, whereas we found little to no evidence that restoration planting age and spatiotemporal factors affected grassland bird populations. Disturbance effects often corresponded to species‐specific responses to changes in vegetation structure. Grassland‐obligate bird diversity was lower in recently burned and ungrazed management units, in comparison to unburned‐ungrazed and unburned‐grazed sites. Henslow's sparrow ( Centronyx henslowii ), a species known to be sensitive to recent prescribed fire, exhibited increased abundance with time since fire, an increase that was further amplified with bison presence. These results highlight the importance of applying varying levels of grazing and fire disturbance to provide variable vegetation structure to accommodate the habitat preferences of a diversity of grassland bird species. Moreover, our results indicate that bison may play a role in mediating the differing effects of variable prescribed fire frequencies on grassland bird species of concern.\"],\n",

       "   \"Abstract In an increasingly diverse nation, calls for education that is culturally relevant have become salient, and student perceptions of school‐based ethnic–racial socialization (ERS) provide insight toward how cultural messages are being interpreted by students. The current study sought to investigate how a sample of racially diverse middle school students ( N = 744) perceptions of ERS are related to social and academic outcomes, and how these associations may differ across race and gender. Structural equation modeling analyses found that for the total sample, students' perceptions of ERS were positively associated with social outcomes and not associated with academic outcomes. Further, these findings did not differ between ethnic–racial groups or genders. The current study informs school and curriculum standards and adds to the literature in understanding that student perceptions of school‐based ethnic–racial socialization do not differ in the impact on outcomes based on race or gender.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Objective This study explored how emotional regulation difficulties and parental psychological control (achievement-oriented) moderate the association between academic enablers (motivation, engagement, study skills, interpersonal skills) and academic skills (reading, writing, mathematics, critical thinking). Method Responses from 157 adolescents (average age = 12, 63% Hispanic, 46% female) using the Academic Competence Evaluation Scales, the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale, and the Achievement-Oriented Psychological Control measure were analyzed using the PROCESS macro conditional analysis model 3 in R (Hayes, 2013). Results Results indicated that emotional regulation moderated the association between academic enablers and academic skills and that this moderation was further moderated by psychological control, F(7, 149) = 63.5, p &amp;lt; 0.00. Specifically, the academic enablers-skills association was stronger for adolescents experiencing higher emotional regulation difficulties and psychological control, Tb7 = 0.0046. Probing the interaction using a modified pick-a-point approach revealed that the conditional effect of the interaction between academic enablers and emotional regulation difficulties on academic skills was significant at the 84th percentile of psychological control, θXW → Y|(Z = 3.11) = 0.0076, p = 0.0075. Alternatively, probing the interaction using the Johnson-Neyman technique revealed that the conditional effect of the interaction between academic enablers and emotional regulation difficulties on academic skills was significant when parental psychological control was greater than or equal to 2.49. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of academic enablers in skill development, especially for adolescents who experience moderate to high emotional regulation difficulties and parental pressure to succeed. Targeted interventions to improve adolescents’ emotional regulation capabilities and lessen controlling parent–child dynamics could be crucial.'],\n",

       "   'Introductory psychology students need supports to read and think in a discipline-specific way when learning psychology theories. We tested the effectiveness of using a task-model steps chart to help students understand, evaluate, and use theories presented in their introductory psychology textbook and lecture videos. We randomly assigned 52 undergraduates enrolled in an asynchronous online introductory psychology course to either the task-model steps chart (experimental) or a business-as-usual assignment (control) section of the course. The outcome measures were Exams 2 and 3 and applied-summary activities. Results demonstrated that although scores were not different between the two conditions at the middle of the course (Exam 2), students in the experimental condition performed better than students in the control condition on Exam 3 on non-targeted (transfer) items and the applied summaries. This study provides initial evidence of the value of supporting students’ disciplinary-specific understanding of the role of theories and studies in psychology. This task-model steps chart is a general tool that can be adapted to help introductory students read and think in psychology.'],\n",

All ligands coordinated to the active-site Zn +2 ion through the sulfonamide group, although sulfapyridine and sulfamonomethoxine, both of which are known antibacterial agents, possess similar binding interactions that are distinct from the other three sulfonamides.

Two crystal structures of Burkholderia thailandensis IspD ( Bt IspD) were determined: an apo structure and that of a complex with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). Comparison of the CTP-bound Bt IspD structure with the apo structure revealed that CTP binding stabilizes the loop composed of residues 13–19. The apo structure of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis IspD ( Mp IspD) is also reported. The melting temperatures of Mp IspD and Bt IspD were evaluated by circular dichroism. The moderate T m values suggest that a thermal shift assay may be feasible for future inhibitor screening. Finally, the binding affinity of CTP for Bt IspD was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. These structural and biophysical data will aid in the discovery of IspD inhibitors.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) are a species of conservation concern throughout their natural range. Headstarting is a common chelonian conservation technique in which neonates are reared in managed-care settings before release, but health assessments are rarely incorporated. From 2020 to 2021 we assessed headstarted turtle health pre-release and 1 mo, 1 yr, and 2 yr after release using physical examination, hematology, plasma biochemistry, protein electrophoresis, and pathogen detection in three Illinois counties. Results were compared to wild-reared juveniles in the same habitats. Overall, 767 assessments from 561 turtles were included. Wild-reared and 2 yr post-release headstarts had higher incidence of hemoparasites, asymmetrical nares, and increased creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase activities (P<0.05) compared to all other groups. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and heterophil:lymphocyte ratio were greater, while total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were lower (P<0.05) in pre-release headstarts compared to wild-reared juveniles. Total solids, albumin, and beta globulins were higher, while the calcium:phosphorous ratio was lower (P<0.05) in pre-release headstarts and wild-reared juveniles vs. other groups. Bile acid levels were highest in pre-release headstarts (P<0.05). Body condition and gamma globulins increased following release, while alpha globulins and the albumin:globulin ratio decreased following release (P<0.05). Two pre-release and one post-release headstart tested positive for Emydomyces testavorans, one post-release headstart was positive for Mycoplasmopsis sp., and nine post-release turtles were positive for adenoviruses. Overall, rearing conditions have a profound and temporally dynamic impact on Blanding's health assessment parameters. Future studies should evaluate long-term impacts on morbidity and mortality to support positive health status and conservation outcomes.\",\n",

       "   \"In recent years, academia's deepened focus on climate change and the growing reliance on ocean resources have enabled a concurrent turn toward the blue humanities, multidisciplinary explorations of the many and diverse connections between the world's oceans and the people who interact with them. This chapter takes a longer view of the blue humanities as a pedagogical concern, through an overview of the 50-year mission and methods of the Sea Education Association, an ocean-focused, study abroad organisation based in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA. Since its founding in 1971, Sea Education Association has trained tertiary- and secondary-level students in ocean sciences, nautical skills, and structured analyses of human–ocean connections across a variety of historical and sociocultural contexts. From detailed studies of environmental-historical data recorded by 19th-century mariners and scientists to present-day reflections on the distinctiveness of oceanic (vs. terrestrial) understandings of place, Sea Education Association has provided a learning platform – on land and at sea – for students' immersive investigations into the experiential and interpretive dimensions of ocean environments.\",\n",

The emphasis is to discuss the role nullors can play in symbolic representation of transfer functions. To show this we adopt the topological platform for the circuit analysis and use a recently developed Admittance Method (AM) to achieve the Sum of Tree Products (STP), replacing the determinant and cofactors of the Nodal Admittance Matrix (NAM) of the circuit. To construct a transfer function, we start with a given active circuit and convert all its controlled sources and I/O-ports to nullors. Now, with a solid nullor circuit (passive elements and nullors) we first eliminate the passive elements through AM operations. This produces the STPs. Second, the all-nullor circuit is then used to find the signs or the STPs. Finally, the transfer function (in symbolic, if chosen) is obtained from the ratio between the STPs.',\n",

Middle meatal antrostomy (MMA) is a widely performed surgical procedure, but its outcomes and complications need further evaluation. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of MMA in alleviating symptoms of chronic maxillary sinusitis and identify potential postoperative complications. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted at Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, from February 2022 to February 2024. Materials and Methods: A total of 120 consenting patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria participated in this prospective study. Patients underwent clinical examinations, nasal endoscopy, and CT scans pre- and postoperatively. MMA was performed under local or general anesthesia using 0°, 30°, and 70° telescopes, back- biting forceps, and a micro debrider. Postoperative care included removal of nasal packing within 24-48 hours and follow-up assessments at 14 days and 3 months. Pre-and postoperative symptoms were compared, and complications were recorded. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27. P value less than 0.05 considered significant. Results: Preoperative symptoms included nasal obstruction (87.5%), facial pain (75.8%), and headaches (63.3%). Postoperatively, nasal obstruction and facial pain decreased to 10.8% and 7.5%, respectively. Persistent headaches were noted in 5.8% of patients who initially reported them, while 71.6% experienced new-onset headaches. Postoperative complications included middle meatal synechiae (14.1%). Conclusions: MMA significantly alleviated preoperative symptoms of chronic maxillary sinusitis, particularly nasal obstruction, facial pain, and headaches. However, postoperative complications, such as new onset headaches and synechiae, underscore the need for careful patient management and further research to optimize outcomes.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract While basaltic volcanism is dominant during rifting and continental breakup, felsic magmatism may be a significant component of some rift margins. During International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 396 on the continental margin of Norway, a graphite‐garnet‐cordierite bearing dacitic unit (the Mimir dacite) was recovered in two holes within early Eocene sediments on Mimir High (Site U1570), a marginal high on the Vøring Transform Margin. Here, we present a comprehensive textural, petrological, and geochemical study of the Mimir dacite in order to assess its origin and discuss the geodynamic implications. The major mineral phases (garnet, cordierite, quartz, plagioclase, alkali feldspar) are hosted in a fresh rhyolitic, vesicular, glassy matrix that is locally mingled with sediments. The major element chemistry of garnet and cordierite, the presence of zircon inclusions with inherited cores, and thermobarometric calculations all support an upper crustal metapelitic origin. While most magma‐rich margin models favor crustal anatexis in the lower crust, thermobarometric calculations performed here show that the Mimir dacite was produced at upper‐crustal depths (&lt;5 kbar, 18 km depth) and high temperature (750–800°C) with up to 3 wt% water content. In situ U‐Pb analyses on zircon inclusions give a magmatic crystallization age of 54.6 ± 1.1 Ma, consistent with emplacement that post‐dates the Paleocene‐Eocene Thermal Maximum. Our results suggest that the opening of the Northeast Atlantic was associated with a phase of low‐pressure, high‐temperature crustal anatexis preceding the main phase of magmatism.',\n",

Understanding patterns of climate change beliefs and behaviours, and the factors which shape these attitudes and actions, is therefore essential. This data note describes the novel data collection of climate belief and behaviour questions embedded within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a longitudinal population-based birth cohort in southwest England. Two generations of ALSPAC participants completed the questionnaires containing these climate questions: the Generation-1 (G1) offspring (<ns5:italic>n</ns5:italic>=4,341), Generation-0 (G0) mothers (<ns5:italic>n</ns5:italic>=4,793), and the G0 mother’s partners (<ns5:italic>n</ns5:italic>=2,111). The questions asked about: belief in climate change; concern over climate change; whether climate change is caused by human activity; whether individual behaviours can impact climate change; the impacts of climate change in the participants’ local area; and whether participants were engaging in any of 17 pro-environmental behaviours (e.g., recycling more, reducing meat/dairy consumption) for climate change and/or other reasons. The majority of participants believed the climate was definitely changing (~80%), were somewhat or very concerned about climate change (~90%) and attributed most or all of climate change to human activity (~75%), with only small differences between the generations. On average, participants reported engaging in between 5 and 6 actions because of concerns regarding climate change (5.8 in G0 mothers; 5.2 in G1 offspring and G0 partners). Associations with sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic background) were relatively weak, but positive relationships between highest level of education and greater climate change belief, concern and behaviours were evident. Increased climate belief and concern also predicted engaging in more pro-environmental actions. Responses to these climate questions were more similar within-families. This data note provides important information for future users of these data, as well as discussing some of the key strengths, limitations and considerations for data users.</ns5:p>'],\n",

       "   \"One grand challenge for deploying porous carbons with embedded metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) moieties as platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is their fast degradation and inferior activity. Here, we report the modulation of the local environment at Fe–N4 sites via the application of atomic Sn–Nx sites for simultaneously improved durability and activity. We discovered that Sn–Nx sites not only promote the formation of the more stable D2 FeN4C10 sites but also invoke a unique D3 SnNx–FeIIN4 site that is characterized by having atomically dispersed bridged Sn–Nx and Fe–N4. This new D3 site exhibits significantly improved stability against demetalation and several times higher turnover frequency for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the shift of the reaction pathway from a single-site associative mechanism to a dual-site dissociative mechanism with the adjacent Sn site facilitating a lower overpotential cleavage of the O–O bond. This mechanism bypasses the formation of the otherwise inevitable intermediate that is responsible for demetalation, where two hydroxyl intermediates bind to one Fe site. As a result, a mesoporous Fe/Sn-PNC catalyst exhibits a positively shifted ORR half-wave potential and more than 50% lower peroxide formation. This, in combination with the stable D3 site and enriched D2 Fe sites, significantly enhanced the catalyst's durability as demonstrated in membrane electrode assemblies using complementary accelerated durability testing protocols.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract Many challenges in lithium‐sulfur (Li–S) batteries are associated with the radical change in lithium polysulfide (LPS) solubility during cycling, but chemical approaches to address such inconsistency are still lacking. Here, the use of a strong Lewis acidic fluorinated organoboron, tri(2,2,2‐trifluoroethyl) borate (TFEB), is reported as a multi‐functional mediator to simultaneously overcome multiple technical barriers in practical Li–S batteries. TFEB acts as an anion acceptor and forms strong molecular complexes with Lewis basic LPS. The TFEB‐LPS complexes have consistent solubility across the full polysulfide spectrum and deliver several times improved better redox kinetics, unlocking a true redox catalytic mechanism that covers the majority of redox events in thick sulfur cathodes. As a result, Li–S batteries evaluated under practical conditions exhibit significantly improved discharge capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability with the addition of the TFEB additive. More importantly, TFEB also contributes to the stabilization of lithium anode in the presence of polysulfides by generating strong interfacial film. These attributes significantly improve the cycling stability of practical Li–S pouch cells, which are assembled with a unit energy density of 219 Wh kg −1 . The results provide new molecular insights on the design of unlocking solvation networks of practical Li–S systems.'],\n",

       "   'Summary Grasses (Poaceae) comprise around 11,800 species and are central for human livelihoods and terrestrial ecosystems. Knowing their relationships and evolutionary history is key to comparative research and crop breeding. Advances in genome-scale sequencing allow for increased breadth and depth of phylogenomic analyses, making it possible to infer a new reference species tree of the family. We inferred a comprehensive species tree of grasses by combining new and published sequences for 331 nuclear genes from genome, transcriptome, target enrichment and shotgun data. Our 1,153-tip tree covers 79% of grass genera (including 21 genera sequenced for the first time) and all but two small tribes. We compared it to a 910-tip plastome tree. The nuclear phylogeny matches that of the plastome at most deep branches, with only a few instances of incongruence. Gene tree–species tree reconciliation suggests that reticulation events occurred repeatedly in the history of grasses. We provide a robust framework for the grass tree of life to support research on grass evolution, including modes of reticulation, and genetic diversity for sustainable agriculture.'],\n",

Research on measurement invariance for telepressure is scarce, especially with respect to occupations. This paper used a moderated nonlinear factor analysis technique to examine how occupational characteristics predict telepressure experiences and differential ratings across two studies with full-time workers. Email-related behaviors and demands predicted factor means and variances of telepressure, but there were no consistent results for job control and time pressure. Invariance testing at the item-level showed that occupational characteristics did not moderate most item parameter estimates; that is, employees interpreted workplace telepressure items equivalently regardless of occupational context.',\n",
       "   'Organizations collect disability-related information from employees to meet legislative requirements, foster inclusion, and respond to employee needs. However, there are likely more employees with disabilities than those who disclose at work. We tested whether altering the response option language on a disclosure form would increase disability disclosures, and whether increases differed by disability type and visibility. Employed adults were asked to identify as having a “disability,” “qualifying impairment,” “qualifying condition,” or “qualifying disability.” Results showed more disclosures when reporting a “qualifying condition” compared to a “disability,” especially among employees with a psychological or invisible disability. The manipulation of a single term on the disclosure form can increase reporting of disabilities, providing an evidence-based step to support inclusive organizational practices.',\n",

With the growing attention to, and numbers of workers with neurodivergence, organizations will experience pressure to rethink the \"typical\" worker and adapt the workplace in ways that appreciate the neurodiversity of their workers. Through this volume, authors have shared empirically and theoretically informed lessons that apply to employment practices guiding selection, evaluation, and support for emerging and current workers with neurodivergent features. Although not complete, these lessons provide the building blocks for organizations to establish a neurodiversity perspective and a workplace that is inclusive of a neurodiverse workforce.',\n",

       "   \"The objective of this study is to examine the factors that impact the inclination of Indian residents towards savings and their adoption of digital financial services. Specifically, the research focuses on identifying the determinants that influence the accessibility and utilisation of financial services among the population. This research endeavour aims to enhance comprehension of financial inclusion and its policy and institutional implications. The paper employs data from the 2021 Global Findex Database, a survey conducted by the World Bank, to evaluate financial inclusion in India. The survey involved 1,000 participants and was conducted with the aim of achieving the paper's objectives. The present study utilises logistic regression and multinomial logistic analysis as its methodological approach to investigate the correlation between diverse factors and saving behaviour and digital financial inclusion. The research highlights key factors affecting saving behavior and digital financial inclusion, such as digital payments, gender, age, education, and income level. It shows that higher income, education, and engagement in digital payments positively impact savings and financial inclusion. Government transfers and agricultural payments also promote savings and digital payments. Policymakers should focus on targeted interventions to support disadvantaged groups and expand access to formal financial institutions, digital payment platforms, and financial literacy programs. Additionally, targeted social protection policies can improve financial wellbeing for vulnerable populations.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract House flies, Musca domestica L., are pests at livestock facilities. House fly numbers are controlled mainly by manure management and chemical controls, like use of toxic baits. Some toxic baits contain denatonium benzoate as a bittering agent, to avoid poisoning of children. House fly behavioral response to denatonium benzoate was examined, using 2 different diluents, sucrose solution or orange juice. Response of flies to quinine and sucrose octaacetate, 2 other bittering agents, was also examined in sucrose. Sucrose is the sweetener in commercially available toxic house fly baits. The proboscis extension response of both male and female flies was significantly reduced by addition of 1,000 ppm of denatonium benzoate to sucrose. Response in males was also reduced at 100 ppm. Consumption of sucrose by both male and female flies was reduced by addition of 100, 500, and 1,000 ppm of denatonium benzoate, but consumption by males was also reduced at 10 ppm. Addition of sucrose octaacetate had no detectable effect on consumption of sucrose at 100, 500, or 1,000 ppm. In contrast, addition of quinine reduced consumption by both male and female flies in all tested concentrations. In orange juice, 10 ppm of denatonium benzoate is often avoided by children. With orange juice, fly proboscis extension response patterns were the same for both sexes, with a reduction at 1,000 ppm of denatonium benzoate. Orange juice consumption by flies was reduced significantly at 1,000 ppm of denatonium benzoate for females but not at any of the concentrations tested for males.'],\n",

       "   \"Problem alcohol drinking continues to be a substantial cost and burden. In addition, alcohol consumption in women has increased in recent decades, and women can have greater alcohol problems and comorbidities. Thus, there is a significant need for novel therapeutics to enhance sex-specific, individualized treatment. Heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) are of broad interest because they may be both biomarkers for and drivers of pathological states. HRV reflects the dynamic balance between sympathetic (SNS, 'fight or flight') and parasympathetic (PNS, 'rest and digest') systems. Evidence from human studies suggest PNS predominance in women and SNS in men during autonomic regulation, indicating the possibility of sex differences in risk factors and physiological drivers of problem drinking. To better understand the association between HRV sex differences and alcohol drinking, we examined whether alcohol consumption levels correlated with time domain HRV measures (SDNN and rMSSD) at baseline, at alcohol drinking onset, and across 10 min of drinking, in adult female and male Wistar rats. In particular, we compared both HRV and HR measures under alcohol-only and compulsion-like conditions (alcohol + 10 mg/L quinine), because compulsion can often be a significant barrier to treatment of alcohol misuse. Importantly, previous work supports the possibility that different HRV measures could be interpreted to reflect PNS versus SNS influences. Here, we show that females with higher putative PNS indicators at baseline and at drinking onset had greater alcohol consumption. In contrast, male intake levels related to increased potential SNS measures at drinking onset. Once alcohol was consumed, HR predicted intake level in females, perhaps a pharmacological effect of alcohol. However, HRV changes were greater during compulsion-like intake versus alcohol-only, suggesting HRV changes (reduced SNS in females, reduced PNS and increased HR in males) specifically related to aversion-resistant intake. We find novel and likely clinically relevant autonomic differences associated with biological sex and alcohol drinking, suggesting that different autonomic mechanisms may promote differing aspects of female and male alcohol consumption.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract The combination of social and environmental stressors significantly influences psychological and physical health in males and females, and contributes to both depression and cardiovascular diseases. Animal models support these findings. Voluntary exercise may protect against some forms of stress; however, the protective effects of exercise against social stressors require further investigation. This study evaluated the influence of exercise on the impact of combined social and environmental stressors in socially monogamous prairie voles. Following a period of social isolation plus additional chronic environmental stress, prairie voles were either allowed access to a running wheel in a larger cage for 2 weeks or remained in sedentary conditions. A behavioral stress task was conducted prior to and following exercise or sedentary conditions. Heart rate (HR) and HR variability were evaluated after exercise or sedentary conditions. Group‐based analyses indicated that exercise prevented elevated resting HR and promoted autonomic control of the heart. Exercise was also effective against social and environmental stress‐induced forced swim test immobility. Some minor sex differences in behavior were observed in response to exercise intensity. This research informs our understanding of the protective influence of physical exercise against social and environmental stressors in male and female humans.',\n",

In this work, we characterize the recombinants encapsidated inside the purified virion particles of BMV and CCMV. By using a tool called the Viral Recombination Mapper (ViReMa) that detects recombination junctions, we analyzed a high number of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) short RNA sequence reads. Over 28% of BMV or CCMV RNA reads did not perfectly map to the viral genomes. ViReMa identified 1.40% and 1.83% of these unmapped reads as the RNA recombinants, respectively, in BMV and CCMV. Intra-segmental crosses were more frequent than the inter-segmental ones. Most intra-segmental junctions carried short insertions/deletions (indels) and caused frameshift mutations. The mutation hotspots clustered mainly within the open reading frames. Substitutions of various lengths were also identified, whereas a small fraction of crosses occurred between viral and their host RNAs. Our data reveal that the virions can package detectable amounts of multivariate recombinant RNAs, contributing to the flexible nature of the viral genomes.',\n",

       "   'Both cognitive and metacognitive theories implicate posttraumatic metacognition as an important factor in the maintenance of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following stressful life events (SLEs). The Metacognitions Questionnaire-posttraumatic stress disorder (MCQ-PTSD; Wells, 2009) was previously developed to assess for metacognitions specific to SLEs and resulting PTSS. This study aimed to examine the construct validity of this measure in the context of childhood SLEs specifically. First, we confirmed the factor structure underlying the MCQ-PTSD in our sample. We then assessed whether the MCQ-PTSD would function as expected based on a theoretical model in which, controlling for posttraumatic cognitions, posttraumatic metacognitions were expected to mediate the relationship between childhood SLEs and PTSS. Using data from a racially diverse sample of undergraduate psychology students ( N = 402; Age mean = 19.38 ± 1.81) at a large Midwestern university, the two-factor structure of the MCQ-PTSD was confirmed. Among participants who endorsed clinically significant experience of childhood SLEs ( n = 203; Age mean = 19.49 ± 1.94), negative metacognitions mediated the relationships of emotional and sexual abuse with PTSS, when controlling for other posttraumatic cognitions. These relationships were not observed for positive metacognitions. These results are consistent with a metacognitive model for PTSD and suggest that the MCQ-PTSD may be a valid measure of posttraumatic metacognitions following childhood SLEs.',\n",
       "   'The ways in which Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms lead to impairments in functioning, including academic performance, are not well understood. The present study sought to examine the role of a common maladaptive coping strategy, experiential avoidance, as a moderator of the relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and academic achievement. Participants ( N = 326) were undergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology courses at a large university in the Midwestern United States who reported at least one event potentially meeting Criterion A for PTSD. The prospective association of PTSS with current and subsequent semester GPAs, and with experiential avoidance as the moderator, were examined. The interaction between PTSS and experiential avoidance significantly predicted both current semester GPA and subsequent semester GPA, with stronger associations between PTSS and GPA being observed at higher levels of experiential avoidance. These results were not fully explained by control variables of high school performance, standardized test scores, and general negative affect. This study found that experiential avoidance significantly moderates the relationship between PTSS and academic performance. These results suggest that interventions that target PTSS and/or experiential avoidance may increase GPA. Limitations and future directions are discussed.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['ABSTRACT Despite traditional dietary categories common in primatology (folivore, frugivore, insectivore), most primates use one or more food types beyond their primary one. Among lemurs, folivores tend to have a complicated, long gastrointestinal tract with an enlarged cecum, shearing teeth, and microbiome adaptations to foliage, while frugivores have simple teeth and guts and fast gut passage. Yet frugivores often eat some leaves, and folivores eat some fruit, and little is known about the selection rules they follow within each food type. We quantified diet and food chemistry for two sympatric rainforest lemurs: a cathemeral frugivore (brown lemur, Eulemur fulvus ) and a diurnal folivore (diademed sifaka, Propithecus diadema ) over 18 and 13 months. Brown lemurs ate 78.3% fruit and 13.0% leaves; sifakas ate 52.8% leaves and 37.9% fruit/seed; both ate fruit/seed most in the resource‐abundant season, increasing leaf/flower consumption in the lean season. Both had diverse diets (128 and 81 plant species) but selected almost entirely different species; however, within fruit and leaf categories, their foods overlapped substantially in nutritional content. They were more selective in their secondary foods: sifakas selected higher‐energy fruits and brown lemurs selected leaves higher in protein and minerals. This indicates a balancing function: frugivores selecting leaves strategically to compensate for low‐protein, low‐mineral fruit and folivores selecting fruit/seed to compensate for low‐energy leaves. That said, it is puzzling why sifakas ignored some leaf species eaten by brown lemurs that were high in protein and minerals—this suggests these nutrients are not prioritized or limiting for sifakas. Other factors likely contribute to the mutual exclusivity in food selection, particularly plant secondary metabolites not measured here or the (poorly‐understood) metabolic costs of eating nutrients in excess. More research is needed to fully understand food choices, how these promote niche differentiation, and their consequences for animals, communities, and ecosystems.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Conservation funding is currently limited; cost‐effective conservation solutions are essential. We suggest that the thousands of field stations worldwide can play key roles at the frontline of biodiversity conservation and have high intrinsic value. We assessed field stations’ conservation return on investment and explored the impact of COVID‐19. We surveyed leaders of field stations across tropical regions that host primate research; 157 field stations in 56 countries responded. Respondents reported improved habitat quality and reduced hunting rates at over 80% of field stations and lower operational costs per km 2 than protected areas, yet half of those surveyed have less funding now than in 2019. Spatial analyses support field station presence as reducing deforestation. These “earth observatories” provide a high return on investment; we advocate for increased support of field station programs and for governments to support their vital conservation efforts by investing accordingly.',\n",

Isotopic research on the island has increasingly helped with biological studies of endemic organisms, including evaluating foraging niches and investigating factors that affect the spatial distribution and abundance of species. The IsoMad database should facilitate future work by making it easy for researchers to access existing data (even for those who are relatively unfamiliar with the literature) and identify both research gaps and opportunities for using various isotope systems to answer research questions.

       "   'The concept of “facilitated restoration” aims at native biodiversity reinstatement with the help of animal seed dispersers attracted by fruiting trees. Yet, large-crowned trees will have to develop in the early stages of restoration; therefore, seed dispersal provided by small generalist mammals and birds that use rapidly growing herbs, shrubs, and small trees at early stages of forest succession would accelerate biodiversity restoration. Due to the elusive lifestyle of these small animals, it is unclear what species can contribute to the early stages of this process. Using the primate genus Microcebus (adult body mass about 60 g) as an example, we illustrate that these small generalists are possible seed dispersers in the early stages of forest restoration, not yet used by larger frugivores. We show that Microcebus spp. dispersed more seeds from herbs, shrubs, and small trees than large frugivorous primate species. These plants tend to have smaller seeds than large tree species and are often pioneer species not considered in forest restoration projects. Facilitating the colonization of restoration plots by generalist small seed dispersers that use shrubby habitats may improve plant diversity by adding a more natural sequence of successional stages towards mature forests in Madagascar and elsewhere in the tropics.'],\n",

       "   'Abstract. Located in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca, the Queshque Glacier (~9.8° S) has experienced nearly continuous retreat since the mid-20th century. More recently, this trend has accelerated after the glacier transitioned from land to lake terminating. We use observations of glacier surface height change (1962–2008), bed topography, and climatology to evaluate the relative drivers of Queshque’s evolution from 1962–2020. Six Open Global Glacier Model ensemble members differing in climatic sensitivity are calibrated to fit the mass balance rate of -442 mm w.e. a-1 calculated over the 2008 glacier area between 1962–2008. The models are then used to simulate monthly glacier mass balance over the entire study period and dynamic glacier evolution from 2008 to 2020. The models reproduce a typical outer-tropical glacier mass balance regime, showing continuous ablation throughout the year that increases during the pronounced wet season. Climatological trend analyses along with coupled mass balance and ice flow simulations indicate that temperature has been the predominant driver of mass loss since 2008 and that recent precipitation levels have caused minor dampening of this trend. The strongest negative correlation between temperature and mass balance occurs during the wet season, while a positive correlation between precipitation and annual mass balance is most pronounced during the dry season. The influence of ENSO over mass balance trends appears to decline throughout the study period except during the wettest months, suggesting that wet season Pacific sea-surface temperatures are strong predictors of outer-tropical glacier mass balance variability. Finally, frontal ablation into the newly formed lake began in 2010. This caused ice acceleration at the glacier front, an average mass loss increase of 4 %, and a significant narrowing of the model ensemble mass loss spread. We conclude that while Queshque’s trajectory remained coupled to climatic forcings, the new proglacial lake exacerbated and modified the retreat pattern regardless of the model climate sensitivity.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['ABSTRACT We investigate the changing snowstorm landscape in eastern North America using dynamically downscaled regional climate simulations that compare the late‐20th century against mid‐ and late‐21st‐century epochs for two climate pathways that include moderate and pessimistic warming. By identifying, tracking, and cataloguing snowstorms, we illustrate how the frequency, snow water equivalent, and other features of these events may change. Results suggest changes in snowstorm characteristics are most significant for the pessimistic pathway, especially toward the late 21st century. There is similar event frequency between the historical period and mid‐21st‐century projections but declines of 3% to 10% are still projected for snowstorm counts, hours, cumulative area, and snow water equivalent. By the late 21st century, snowstorm attributes have losses of 6% to 37% versus the historical period, revealing a projected acceleration in loss from the mid to late century. Spatially, snowstorm reduction is most dramatic along and south of the Ohio River Valley as the latitude that separates steady snowstorm counts to the north and reduced snowstorms to the south migrates poleward in the future. Similarly, extreme snowstorms decline to the south, with some northern regions experiencing increase in counts and snow water equivalent, affirming prior research theorising that some snowfall may intensify as increasing moisture in a warming climate interacts with environments with temperatures still supportive of snowfall. Significant reductions in early and late cool‐season snowstorms are projected across all future epochs, revealing a shrinking season. These results provide a set of perspectives on how a dominant cryospheric input—the snowstorm—will change across eastern North America in the future.',\n",
       "   \"Changes in the properties of severe climatic events like rainstorms and droughts are expected to impact erosion rates significantly under modern global warming. Also over the recent geologic past and especially in drylands catchments, hydrological and vegetation transitions following changes in spatiotemporal properties of climatic phenomena have been suggested as triggers for periods of enhanced erosion that affected societies' sustainability and left pronounced topographic imprints. However, these potential drivers remain incompletely understood and quantified. This is, in part, because the discrete events that trigger erosion are hard to observe and the fine-scale processes needed to model erosion are computationally intensive to run over landscape evolution timescales.To address this, we developed a new catchment-scale landscape evolution model based on the Landlab toolkit that explicitly represents episodic failures, sub-minute hydrology, overland-driven sediment transport, and erosion-vegetation links. We validated the model against event-based runoff and sediment records from the Lucky Hills site in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona, USA. After validation, we conducted a set of stochastic numerical experiments of landscape evolution in response to changes in sub-daily rainfall distribution, without considering changes in vegetation properties. We ran an additional set of simulations that integrated the landscape evolution model with historical and future climate records for the High Plains of Colorado, driven by a convection-permitting weather model (CPM). This experimental set allows us to explore changes in vegetation cover and its influence on sediment yield and topographic evolution under modern global warming.We found that changes in the tail of the sub-daily rainfall distribution&amp;#8212;changes similar to recent observations under modern global warming&amp;#8212;could raise the total sediment yield by ~40% and alter the catchment morphology. Modeled sediment yield increased in response to the rising frequency of rare, high-magnitude storms, even when there was no significant change in the mean storm properties or annual rainfall. Further, we found that catchment erosion could increase even under a reduction in the mean conditions if the sub-daily rainfall distribution shifted toward a heavier tail. Numerical experiments driven by the CPM data confirm that under projected future conditions in the High Plains, erosion is expected to increase, even though the mean conditions become drier. Our simulations also reveal that the presence of vegetation impacts the morphology of the catchment, reducing channel density and preserving gullies' headcuts. Overall, this study contributes insight into the role of rainstorm properties and vegetation cover on landscape evolution, illuminates potential climatic triggers for past aggradation and degradation stages in low-order catchments, and provides valuable information for erosion risks under anthropogenic climatic and environmental changes.\",\n",
       "   \"Abstract Precise, accurate, and reliable crop condition data continues to be in demand for farmers, agribusiness, government agencies, agroclimatologists, and research institutions. This study evaluated the data quality of four major United States field crops: corn ( Zea mays L.), cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), soybeans ( Glycine max L.), and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's (NASS) Gridded Crop Progress and Condition dataset. Upon aggregating the weekly 9 km gridded data to the county level (and further to the state and national level) over the 2015–2023 period, no statistically significant differences emerged between the gridded condition data and the tabular condition data from the USDA NASS Crop Progress and Condition Report (CPCR). In line with state and national‐level analyses, a strong linear relationship between crop conditions and yield existed at the county scale. County‐level crop condition ratings were a statistically significant covariate of yield during the critical reproduction period through harvest for 90% of corn, 78% of cotton, 90% of soybean, and 96% of winter wheat‐producing counties. In addition, intramonthly county‐level crop conditions changed accordingly based on the magnitude of temperature and precipitation anomalies during certain phenological stages. In at least 80% of counties for each respective crop, temperatures and precipitation were statistically significant covariates for crop condition changes. The relationships between USDA NASS gridded crop condition data, CPCR data, yield, and climate substantiate the utility and fidelity of this dataset as a representation of confidential crop condition reports, supporting its practical application in research and operational decision‐making.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Elevated mixed layers (EMLs) influence the severe convective storm climatology in the contiguous United States (CONUS), playing an important role in the initiation, sustenance, and suppression of storms. This study creates a high-resolution climatology of the EML to analyze variability and potential changes in EML frequency and characteristics for the first time. An objective algorithm is applied to ERA5 to detect EMLs, defined in part as layers of steep lapse rates (≥8.0°C km −1 ) at least 200 hPa thick, in the CONUS and northern Mexico from 1979 to 2021. EMLs are most frequent over the Great Plains in spring and summer, with a standard deviation of 4–10 EML days per year highlighting sizable interannual variability. Mean convective inhibition associated with the EML’s capping inversion suggests many EMLs prohibit convection, although—like nearly all EML characteristics—there is considerable spread and notable seasonal variability. In the High Plains, statistically significant increases in EML days (4–5 more days per decade) coincide with warmer EML bases and steeper EML lapse rates, driven by warming and drying in the low levels of the western CONUS during the study period. Additionally, increases in EML base temperatures result in significantly more EML-related convective inhibition over the Great Plains, which may continue to have implications for convective storm frequency, intensity, severe perils, and precipitation if this trend persists. Significance Statement Elevated mixed layers (EMLs) play a role in the spatiotemporal frequency of severe convective storms and precipitation across the contiguous United States and northern Mexico. This research creates a detailed EML climatology from a modern reanalysis dataset to uncover patterns and potential changes in EML frequency and associated meteorological characteristics. EMLs are most common over the Great Plains in spring and summer, but show significant variability year-to-year. Robust increases in the number of days with EMLs have occurred since 1979 across the High Plains. Lapse rates associated with EMLs have trended steeper, in part due to warmer EML base temperatures. This has resulted in increasing EML convective inhibition, which has important implications for regional climate.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Short-duration, high-intensity rainfall can initiate deadly and destructive debris flows after wildfire. Methods to estimate the conditions that can trigger debris flows exist and guidance to determine how often those thresholds will be exceeded under the present climate are available. However, the limited spatiotemporal resolution of climate models has hampered efforts to characterize how rainfall intensification driven by global warming may affect debris-flow hazards. We use novel, dynamically downscaled (3.75-km), convection-permitting simulations of short-duration (15-min) rainfall to evaluate threshold exceedance for late 21st-century climate scenarios in the American Southwest. We observe significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of exceedances for regions dominated by cool- and warm-season rainfall. We also observe an increased frequency of exceedance in regions where postfire debris flows have not been documented, and communities are unaccustomed to the hazard. Our findings can inform planning efforts to increase resiliency to debris flows under a changing climate.',\n",
       "   'Hailstorms are analyzed across the United States using explicit hailstone size calculations from convection-permitting regional climate simulations for historical, mid-century, and end of twenty-first-century epochs. Near-surface hailstones <4 cm are found to decrease in frequency by an average of 25%, whereas the largest stones are found to increase by 15–75% depending on the greenhouse gas emissions pathway. Decreases in the frequency of near-surface severe hail days are expected across the U.S. High Plains, with 2–4 fewer days projected—primarily in summer. Column-maximum severe hail days are projected to increase robustly in most locations outside of the southern Plains, a distribution that closely mimics projections of thunderstorm days. Primary mechanisms for the changes in hailstone size are linked to future environments supportive of greater instability opposed by thicker melting layers. This results in a future hailstone size dichotomy, whereby stronger updrafts promote more of the largest hailstones, but significant decreases occur for a majority of smaller diameters due to increased melting.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Tornado risk, as determined by the occurrence of atmospheric conditions that support tornado incidence, has exhibited robust spatial trends in the United States Southern Plains and Mid-South during recent decades. The consequences of these risk changes have not been fully explored, especially in conjunction with growing societal vulnerability. Herein, we assess how changes in risk and vulnerability over the last 40 years have collectively and individually altered tornado-housing impact potential. Results indicate that escalating vulnerability and exposure have outweighed the effects of spatially changing risk. However, the combination of increasing risk and exposure has led to a threefold increase in Mid-South housing exposure since 1980. Though Southern Plains tornado risk has decreased since 1980, amplifying exposure has led to more than a 50% increase in mean annual tornado-housing impact potential across the region. Stakeholders should use these findings to develop more holistic mitigation and resilience-building strategies that consider a dynamically changing tornado disaster landscape.',\n",
       "   'Abstract USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service general crop condition data are used to quantify the relationship between crop conditions and yield, condition tendencies during the growing season, how conditions vary across the United States, and how conditions have trended for the 1986–2022 period for a variety of crops: barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), corn ( Zea mays L.), cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), oats ( Avena sativa L.), peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea L.), rice ( Oryza sativa L.), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L.), soybeans ( Glycine max L.), and spring and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Crop conditions are a statistically significant covariate (90% significance level) for yield and can be used in practice on a weekly basis. This becomes increasingly important as, historically, crop conditions not only deteriorated on average, but also became more variable throughout the growing season. Spatial differences in conditions, variability, and trends in condition ratings and variability are caused by crop selection, regional climate, and management practices such as irrigation. Crop conditions were poorest and had the highest interannual variability across the southern Great Plains region. Since 1986, crop conditions in the Great Plains region have deteriorated significantly, while variability has increased. Meanwhile, crop conditions across the southwestern and southeastern United States have significantly improved, while interannual variability in conditions has experienced robust declines. Given climatic and hydrologic trends, to maintain a positive trend in yield, continued advancements in production management and technology are required. Critical decisions regarding real‐time or future management can be supplemented by using crop condition risk assessment information along with actively monitoring weekly conditions.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract This research seeks to understand simulated supercell precipitation characteristics across the conterminous United States (CONUS) using high‐resolution, convection‐permitting, dynamically downscaled simulations for three 15‐year epochs. Epochs include a historical end‐of‐20th‐century period (1990–2005) and two end‐of‐21st‐century (2085–2100) scenarios for intermediate and pessimistic greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Simulated updraft helicity, which measures the corkscrew flow within a storm's updraft, is used as a proxy for supercells. An algorithm tracks and catalogues updraft helicity swaths that, when buffered, are used to acquire simulated precipitation from supercells. The historical epoch provides a baseline climatology of supercell precipitation for a contemporary climate, which is then compared against the two future epochs to assess how supercell precipitation may change during the 21st century. Despite their relatively small size, supercells provide critical precipitation to the Wheat and Corn Belts, large expanses of CONUS pasture and rangeland, regional aquifers and several large river basins. Many areas in the central CONUS receive upwards of 3%–6% of their annual and 5%–8% of their warm‐season precipitation from these storms. Results suggest that precipitation contribution from supercells will decrease in the future across most of the High Plains and Central and Northern Great Plains with robust increases likely across the south‐central and Southeast regions. Supercell precipitation rates are expected to increase for large portions of the CONUS by the end‐of‐the‐21st‐century, suggesting a growing threat for flash floods from these storms as they become more efficient precipitation producers. This research provides an initial perspective on the magnitude of supercell precipitation and potential changes to this important hydrologic input to assist water‐sensitive industries, private and public insurance markets, agriculture entities, as well as inform plans to mitigate and build resilience to rapid environmental and societal change.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract The potential for changes in extreme precipitation events due to anthropogenic climate change may have significant societal impacts (e.g., agricultural productivity, property loss, mortality). This project uses a dynamically downscaled, convection-permitting regional climate model to investigate extreme daily precipitation in the CONUS, defined explicitly as the 99th percentile 24-h accumulated value. The simulation output includes a historical baseline (HIST; 1990–2005) and two epochs at the end of the twenty-first century (EOC; 2085–2100) under intermediate and pessimistic emissions scenarios. Independent observations illustrate that HIST admirably represents extreme precipitation climatology for most locations in the domain. Comparisons between HIST and the two EOC scenarios for the 99th percentile of daily precipitation show statistically significant increases during Dec–May across the Midwest and Ohio Valley and statistically significant decreases for the southern Great Plains during Dec–Feb. Extreme value analysis further reveals increasing variability in precipitation extremes for eight climatologically unique cities across the CONUS by the end of the twenty-first century and significant increases in return period precipitation amounts for most cities examined. These results provide additional guidance for stakeholders to reduce societal impacts and economic loss from daily precipitation extremes and create a more climate-resilient society.',\n",

       "   'Abstract This study uses high-resolution, convection-permitting, dynamically downscaled regional climate simulation output to assess how long-lived, convectively induced, extratropical windstorms known as derechos may change across the CONUS during the 21st century. Three 15-year epochs including a historical period (1990 – 2005), and two, separate late-21st century periods (2085 – 2100) employing intermediate (RCP 4.5) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas concentration scenarios are evaluated. A mesoscale convective system (MCS) identification and tracking tool catalogs derecho candidates across epochs using simulated radar reflectivity and maximum 10-meter wind speed as a proxy for near-surface severe wind gusts. Results indicate that MCS-based windstorms, including derechos, are more frequent, widespread, and intense in both future climate scenarios examined for most regions of the central and eastern CONUS. Increases are suggested across all parts of the year, with significant changes in populations concentrated during the early spring and summer months, suggesting the potential for a longer, more extreme MCS windstorm season. This research provides insights for forecasters, emergency managers, and wind-vulnerable stakeholders on how these events may change across the 21 st century so that they may mitigate, adapt to, and become resilient against severe convective storm perils.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Changes in the frequency and intensity of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are assessed using convection-permitting regional climate model simulations. We present a novel classification method that relates MCSs to the magnitude of their large-scale forcing environments to better understand the changing nature of MCSs across different forcing environments in a possible future climate scenario. Overall, the annual frequency, intensity, and amount of precipitation associated with MCSs are projected to increase for broad portions of the eastern conterminous United States (CONUS). Furthermore, changes in the characteristics of MCSs show larger, longer-lived, and faster MCSs particularly over the Midwest and Southeast. Seasonal examination of this response reveals a robust intensification of March–May (MAM) MCSs. The higher frequency of MAM MCSs are found to occur in weakly forced synoptic environments. Increased rainfall amounts are explained by an intensification of MCSs due to changing thermodynamics and enhanced lower-tropospheric moisture transport into the central CONUS by the North Atlantic Subtropical High. Differences in mid-latitude storm tracks are favorable towards the enhanced development of MCSs associated with strong baroclinic forcing within the Midwest and Northern Plains, but are only realized in the presence of strong changes in lower-tropospheric moisture transport. Overall, these results suggest a shift in the behavior of MAM MCSs that more closely corresponds to the behavior of June–August (JJA) MCSs in the historical climate. The increased occurrence of MCSs in weakly forced environments, particularly in MAM, deserves further investigation.',\n",
       "   'Abstract USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service pasture and rangeland condition data were used to establish a novel spatiotemporal climatology of condition ratings across the conterminous United States for the May–October grazing season over the 1995–2022 study period. On average, the coverage of grazing land that provides adequate or excess feed underwent a significant reduction during a typical season. Spatially, the southwestern United States exhibited the poorest grazing land conditions on average, with over 20 years below the national mean condition rating. At the national aggregated level, conditions degraded during the 28‐year study period, and the most significant trends were observed for grazing lands considered to have poor or very poor condition coverage, which increased. Robustly increasing trends in poor and very poor condition coverage were most apparent across the western half of the United States, which is predominantly rangeland. Meanwhile, the eastern half of the United States, which is mostly pastureland, generally experienced condition improvements. Overall, continued regional climatic changes that may result in increasing temperatures, variable precipitation totals, and subsequent soil moisture declines leading to increased drought instances will continue to impose challenges for grazing land managers. Grazing land condition declines can result in increased feed supply demand and reduced grazing capacity. Should these trends continue, there will be a growing need for flexible livestock, forage, and grazing management strategies in the coming decades to adapt to climate change‐induced impacts on water‐sensitive ecosystems.'],\n",

Two crystal structures of Burkholderia thailandensis IspD ( Bt IspD) were determined: an apo structure and that of a complex with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). Comparison of the CTP-bound Bt IspD structure with the apo structure revealed that CTP binding stabilizes the loop composed of residues 13–19. The apo structure of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis IspD ( Mp IspD) is also reported. The melting temperatures of Mp IspD and Bt IspD were evaluated by circular dichroism. The moderate T m values suggest that a thermal shift assay may be feasible for future inhibitor screening. Finally, the binding affinity of CTP for Bt IspD was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. These structural and biophysical data will aid in the discovery of IspD inhibitors.',\n",

       "   'A previous gas-phase study has uncovered formal catalytic cycles for the dehydrogenation of model liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) pyrrolidine, N-methylpyrrolidine, and piperidine by the coordinatively unsaturated half-sandwich cyclopentadienyl iron cation, [CpFe]+. That work is extended here to the well-known condensed-phase [CpFe(CO)2]+ cation, which was generated via electrospray ionization for gas-phase reactions with model LOHCs in a linear ion trap mass spectrometer, in which the helium bath gas was seeded with 0.1% carbon monoxide. The initial ion–molecule reaction (IMR) was exothermic enough to expel one CO molecule from the complex to form [CpFe(CO)L]+ (L = pyrrolidine, N-methylpyrrolidine, or piperidine). Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of these cations revealed two fragmentation pathways: (i) removal of another CO molecule leading to the species [CpFeL]+ that was studied previously; (ii) dehydrogenation of the ligand L (except for L= N-methylpyrrolidine). Two new formal catalytic cycles (for dehydrogenation of pyrrolidine and piperidine) were found that operate via a combination of IMR and CID experiments and which rely on the presence of CO for re-ligation of iron complexes. Density functional theory calculations were performed to compute the structures of all species observed as well as the reaction energetics.'],\n",

       "   \"In smart power grids, electricity theft causes huge economic losses to electrical utility companies. Machine learning (ML), especially deep neural network (DNN) models hold state-of-the-art performance in detecting electricity theft cyberattacks. However, DNN models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., evasion attacks. In this work, we study the vulnerability of the DNN-based electricity theft detectors against evasion attacks and the influence of the model's regularization (generalization) on robustness. We cluster the power consumers and train a detector for each cluster, and compare the performance and robustness of this detector to a global detector that is trained on all the consumers, data. The results indicate that the cluster-based detector is not only more robust against evasion attacks but also enhances normal classification accuracy because its training data has more consumption pattern similarity compared to the training data of the global detector which requires higher level of regularization. Moreover, unlike the existing solutions that sacrifice the normal accuracy of the model to improve the robustness against evasion attacks, the proposed cluster-based detector holds state-of-the-art performance in both robustness and accuracy.\",\n",

Performance parameters such as Quality factor (Q-factor) and Bit error rate (BER) of an optical fiber fronthaul segment are the main important parameters to enhance latency and bit rate. An Apodized fiber bragg grating (AFBG) is utilized with different apodization profiles to optimize linewidth of an optical signal leading to enhance performance. The designed AFBG is used with a data rate of 25 Gb/s optical Ethernet module at the vDU edge cloud to optimize the linewidth of the optical signal between the vDU and the RRU in the fronthaul optical fiber segment. The AFBG is investigated at different connections pre, post, and symmetrical connections, where different apodization functions are used in the AFBG design. It is found that the best results for the maximum Q-factor and minimum BER are 9.2 and 2.72e− 21, respectively, obtained from uniform function in the symmetrical connection. Finally, the proposed model linewidth is 0.408 nm, which is better than 1.56 nm that is evaluated by related work.',\n",

       "   '<title>Abstract</title> Network slicing enables new revenue opportunities for service providers by allowing them to offer customized network services tailored to various industry verticals and use cases. 5G network uses slicing technology to enable the creation of tailored network slices to support diverse use cases, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). However, the complexity of network slicing also introduces challenges, such as maintaining service-level agreements (SLAs), quality of service (QoS), security across multiple slices, and service provisioning and dynamic allocation of resources. This paper develops a novel Federated Network Slicing Orchestrator (FNSO) that uses the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method to rank and select the proper telecommunication service provider that runs at certain edge Points of Presence (EPoP) of the 5G-based IOT network for slice deployment. The proposed FNSO integrates the Hexagonal Fuzzy approach with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to address the shortcoming of the TOPSIS and to rank and select the proper EPoP that can host the network slice using numeric and fuzzy Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as the security, cost, and performance criteria. Furthermore, we augment the FNSO with a Secure Federated Learning (SFL) model to protect the local 5G domain service provisioning KPIs and secure the FNSO against potential attacks. The experiment results depict that the average slice acceptance ratio of the FNSO is higher than the current solutions such as GRU-DNN, VIKOR-CNSP, and T-S3RA by 28.2%, 10.13%, and 6.1%. Furthermore, On average, the SFL model is faster than the DeTrust-FL, HybridAlpha-FL, PHE-FL, and HybridOne-FL by 7.11%, 7.21%, 15.73%, and 20.61% respectively, and slower than Classic-FL, on average, by 4.37% due to the secure aggregation that the SFL offers.',\n",

However, it poses substantial experimental difficulties due to large backgrounds, the requirement for monochromatised $e^+e^-$ beams, and the potential extension of the FCC-ee timeline. Given this, we explore the extent to which the electron Yukawa coupling can be enhanced in simplified UV models and examine whether such scenarios can be constrained by other FCC-ee runs or upcoming experiments at the intensity frontier. Our results indicate that in certain classes of models, the $(g-2)_e$ provides a probe of the electron Yukawa coupling that is as effective or better than the FCC-ee. Nevertheless, there exist models that can lead to sizeable deviations in the electron Yukawa coupling which can only be probed in a dedicated run at the Higgs pole mass.',\n",

       "   'The first section of any coherent electron cooling (CeC) system is the modulator, where the density of the electron beam is modulated by the copropagating ion beam. This density modulation is a result of Coulomb collisions between the individual particles of the two beams. The pairwise, stochastic part of the interactions impacts the overall performance of the CeC process. We present the first simulations of the density modulations of the electron beams from a collisional picture of the dynamics, considering the proof-of-principle CeC experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory. These simulations were performed using PHAD, which is the first efficient, large-scale collisional numerical method in beam physics that we have previously developed and benchmarked. Realistic beam distributions and external fields have been optimized to provide strong modulation signals necessary for variations of coherent electron cooling systems. Cooling performance limits and potential collisionless simulation pitfalls are pointed out.',\n",
       "   'In classical electrodynamics, the well-known Lorentz force law falls short of providing a satisfactory result for the trajectory of point-like charged particles when considering that particle’s own self-force. While there have been many historical attempts, Gralla, Harte and Wald developed a new model for classical charged particles that is free from pathologies while being consistent with Maxwell’s equations and conserves stress-energy. Expanding upon this approach, we derive a relativistically correct, modified Lorentz force law in vector form, which includes radiation reaction, and spin- and magnetic moment-dependent correction terms, suitable to be included in classical electrodynamics lectures and beam dynamics simulation tools. As by-products we obtain evolution equations for mass, spin angular momentum and the radiated power. We compare the new equations to the classical ones and use the new equations to conduct numerical simulations, showing that the results are free of any nonphysical artifacts, and which might be possible to test in future experiments at particle accelerators. The new equations foster improved insight into beam dynamics.',\n",

Specifically, no such systems exist with invariants quadratic in the momenta, precluding straightforward generalization of the Courant-Snyder theory of linear integrable systems in beam physics. We also conjecture that no such systems exist with invariants of higher degree in the momenta. This leaves solenoidal magnetic fields, including their nonlinear fringe fields, as the only completely integrable static magnetic fields, albeit with invariants that are linear in the momenta. The difficulties come from enforcing Maxwell equations; without constraints, we show that there are many solutions. In particular, we discover a previously unknown large family of integrable Hamiltonians.\",\n",

       "   'We investigate models that can induce significant modifications to the couplings of first- and second-generation quarks with Higgs bosons. Specifically, we identify all simplified models featuring two vector-like quark states which can lead to substantial enhancements in these couplings. In addition, these models generate operators in Standard Model Effective Field Theory, both at tree-level and one-loop, that are constrained by electroweak precision and Higgs data. We show how to evade constraints from flavour physics and consider direct searches for vector-like quarks. Ultimately, we demonstrate that viable ultraviolet models can be found with first-generation quark Yukawa couplings enhanced by several hundred times their Standard Model value, while the Higgs couplings to charm (strange) quarks can be increased by factors of a few (few tens). Given the importance of electroweak precision data in constraining these models, we also discuss projections for future measurements at the Tera-$Z$ FCC-ee machine.'],\n",

This qualitative study investigated the experiences of 12 STEM scholarship recipients in a near-peer-mentored social support group at a large Midwestern university. The goal of this study was to investigate the scholars’ challenges and supports prior to and while participating in a weekly peer group through the lens of the Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory model. This case study triangulated the experiences of the peer group participants using pre-group individual interviews, peer leader reflections, and a focus group. The pre-group interviews revealed that the participants experienced challenges associated with the rigor of their courses, self-imposed pressure, and unsupportive relationships. Supports for their persistence prior to the peer group included their internal drive to achieve their goals and supportive relationships, particularly with family. The focus group revealed that the peer group provided a non-academic space to connect with peers, facilitated sense of belonging, and normalized their struggle as STEM majors, broadening their perception of science identity. Paradoxically, although participants highlighted personal disclosure as key to promoting social support, they indicated their greatest challenge in the peer group was discomfort with sharing.',\n",
       "   'The geological sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (geo-STEM) have the capacity to investigate and address geological and environmental challenges. Many of these challenges (e.g., pollution, flooding, and slope failure) unjustly impact lower socio-economic communities in urban and rural settings where there is limited access to geo-STEM expertise. Geo-STEM learning ecosystems (GLEs) integrate geo-STEM and social science research paradigms to broaden civic engagement in the geosciences. GLEs are communities of practice consisting of geo-STEM professionals, educators, and learners who address local issues through place-based STEM research and education. The purpose of this study was to connect the concept of GLEs with the extant literature on learning ecosystems. We conducted a thematic review of the literature evaluating how the term \"learning ecosystem\" is used in psychology, educational technology, and STEM education research. We categorized the learning ecosystem components described in the literature in terms of inputs (e.g., motivation, software, learning environment), processes (e.g., cognition, device development, curriculum), and outputs (e.g., creativity, innovation, engagement). This approach revealed themes aligned with GLE-relevant research on communities of practice, and place-based and problem-based education, connecting GLEs to a century of existing research. To demonstrate how to use a GLE framework, we analyze the attributes of three existing programs through the GLE lens. Based on our findings, we recommend that to build GLEs geo-STEM researchers should: engage in transdisciplinary collaborations to develop local geo-STEM solutions, use the GLE framework to assess geoscience education and outreach programs, evaluate the role of place in efforts to engage diverse communities, and leverage other fields of inquiry to broaden our theoretical understanding of GLEs.',\n",

       "   \"The geoscience education research (GER) community has evolved and grown over the past several decades. Using Wenger et al.'s Community of Practice (CoP) model (2002), we discuss how the GER CoP (which is broader than the formal discipline of GER) has changed, highlighting noteworthy events and growth points. Trends in community membership and connections are noted. Additionally, we conducted a GER community needs assessment to identify ways in which the CoP could build on its momentum. The survey included questions on CoP member demographics, engagement in GER work, and professional development needs. We received 107 responses, primarily from the United States and from individuals with geology or atmospheric science backgrounds. The survey highlighted the need for intentional outreach to international venues, K-12 teacher audiences, and underrepresented groups in the GER community. The survey also revealed the various ways in which GER CoP members engage in research, teaching, and dissemination activities. The most commonly used resources for increasing GER knowledge were the SERC site and the Journal of Geoscience Education (JGE). Respondents expressed a strong desire for professional development opportunities, including methodological training and community knowledge exchanges. Based on the survey results, recommendations are proposed to enhance the inclusivity, mentorship, and dissemination efforts within the GER community. The findings emphasize the importance of networking, expanding resources, and addressing the needs of diverse members to foster a vibrant and inclusive GER community.\",\n",
       "   \"Abstract Persistence across undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs is exceptionally low. Recent studies have shown that social support and sense of belonging are particularly important for students who are historically underrepresented in STEM, yet few interventions have directly targeted or investigated these factors. This qualitative study investigates low‐income, high‐achieving undergraduate STEM students' perceptions of their belonging in the context of a 2‐year peer social support group intervention. Interview analysis of 11 participants demonstrates that these STEM students attribute their sense of belonging to feelings or displays of comfort, commonality, community, and concerted effort. The peer group facilitated increases in participants' social support and sense of belonging by allowing participants to build friendships, recognize shared experiences, connect to their campus, build confidence with peers, and feel supported in their non‐academic and academic struggles. Although the program's main objective was to build participants' sense of belonging, the social support provided through the peer group also acted as a mechanism for increasing information‐related social capital. We recommend the implementation of similar non‐academic, supportive social spaces to increase the sense of belonging and overall persistence of low‐income STEM students.\"],\n",

The present study surveyed 400 workers employed on the production line at a tire manufacturing company in the Republic of Korea. This study revealed a predominantly male workforce, a majority of married employees, an older age demographic, a diverse range of employment tenures with a significant portion of long-term staff, and variability in rest period durations and frequencies. An analysis of data from tire manufacturing workers revealed that high job autonomy and relationship conflict contributed to lower job satisfaction and increased stress. Generational conflicts between older, experienced workers and younger employees further exacerbated dissatisfaction. Despite the physically demanding nature of the job, no significant difference in physical ability across age groups was observed. This study also found a high burnout index, characterized by cynicism, emotional exhaustion, and decreased professional efficacy, particularly among those performing repetitive tasks. The findings suggest a need for interventions to address burnout and improve job conditions for the aging workforce.',\n",

Eight participants performed these tasks with and without the exoskeleton. Significant reductions (19%; p < 0.05) in erector spinae muscle activity were observed during tasks 2 and 4. Moreover, peak bilateral hip flexion angles decreased by up to 29° across tasks, with a notable decrease in median hip flexion angles in three tasks, except for task 3. These findings suggest that the exoskeleton may offer benefits in reducing lower back muscular strain during certain patient transfer tasks, indicating its potential utility in healthcare settings. Further research is needed to fully assess its effectiveness and practicality in improving patient-handling techniques.',\n",

Results showed significant effects of sex, forearm posture and lifting height on back strength. Males demonstrated higher strength than females, and a pronated forearm posture increased strength by 10% compared to supination. The MLP model achieved the highest predictive accuracy (r = 0.896), outperforming other models.

Results demonstrated a significant reduction in the lower back muscle activity, but less pronounced effects for other tasks involving minimal trunk flexion. Hip flexion angles were reduced for all tasks when the exoskeleton was worn. The amount of reduction in the muscle activity and changes in the trunk and hip angles varied by task.

A total of 15 participants (7 females and 8 males) performed a typing task with and without virtual hand representations. The optical motion capture data was utilized to capture the upper extremity angles, and electromyography device was used to collect the neck muscle activities (left and right splenius capitis). The results showed that the typing performance, upper extremity angle, neck muscle activity, and usability were significantly different with and without virtual hand representations. With the virtual hand representation, net typing speed (WPM) and usability increased significantly by 171.4% and 25% compared to the without hand representation.

       "   \"Abstract The purpose of this three-year project (funded by NSF EHR-ITEST) is to develop an innovative mixed-reality environment that supports early development of computational thinking. Grounded in embodied cognition and social robotics, the project team is designing and studying an environment that combines augmented reality (AR) technology and a physically embodied social robot. In this environment, children in K-2 walk around on a 5x5 chessboard-like grid on a floor mat to help a robot (Linibot) find a path toward a goal while holding a tablet. The robot guides children with instructions, cues, and corrective and motivational feedback. The tablet displays an equivalent map and several AR obstacles for the child to avoid. The specific learning objectives are foundational STEM problem solving skills including the understanding of symbols and sequences that are crosscutting STEM domains, and developing children's confidence in advanced technology use. Importantly, we unobtrusively assess children's progresses while they play in the environment by using multimodal behavioral data collection technology such as automated interaction logs capturing their walking distance and time taken to the goal and an optical motion capture system and electromyography (EMG) to precisely collect bodily gestures, postures, and socio-emotional dynamics. We have been developed the mixed-reality environment iteratively over one and a half years, testing our ongoing designs with twenty-five children in informal settings (our lab, a community center, and a STEM showcase event). Each test has had a different focus dependent on the developmental progress of the environment. In this poster session, we will present the results of our most recent implementation with seventeen boys and girls one-on-one in a local one-day STEM showcase event held two weeks ago.

Currently we are analyzing the data from the interaction logs to assess each child's walking distance and time taken to the goal, while fine-tuning the design of AR-enabled obstacles and the robot's utterances. Following this, we will analyze the data from the sensor technologies (bodily gestures, postures, and socio-emotional dynamics) and compare these two sets of data to understand how the data sets will enable assessing children's learning progresses authentically.

       "   \"Abstract Over the course of a three-year period, supported by NSF EHR-ITEST funding, this project aims to create a pioneering mixed-reality setting to facilitate the early cultivation of computational thinking. Rooted in the principles of embodied cognition and social robotics, the project team is in the process of crafting and examining an environment that seamlessly integrates augmented reality (AR) technology with a physically embodied social robot. Within this setting, kindergarten through second-grade students navigates a floor mat designed as a 5x5 chessboard-like grid while assisting a robot named Linibot in charting a path toward a predetermined destination. To aid them in this endeavor, the children hold a tablet through which the robot provides guidance in the form of instructions, cues, and constructive as well as motivational feedback. Concurrently, the tablet screen displays a corresponding map and various augmented reality obstacles for the children to navigate around. The primary educational goals of this experience encompass building foundational STEM problem-solving skills, fostering an understanding of symbols and sequences that transcend various STEM domains, and instilling confidence in young learners' proficiency in advanced technology utilization. To assess the effectiveness of the envisaged mixed-reality learning setting, individual children underwent pre-and post-tests. Throughout these assessments, children addressed analogous path-finding challenges on a tablet by manipulating and placing different arrows. Additionally, two distinct groups were designated: a control group, devoid of mixed-reality environments, and an intervention group, exposed to mixed-reality environments. The aim is to compare the computational thinking skills of each group and gauge the impact of the mixed-reality learning environment on skill development. Iteratively developed over a span of two and a half years, the mixed-reality environment underwent continuous refinement, with ongoing designs subjected to testing involving thirty-five children in diverse informal settings, including our lab, a community center, and STEM showcase events.

       "   'This study explored the use of forearm electromyography data to distinguish eight hand gestures. The neural network (NN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were tested on data from 10 participants. As window sizes increase from 200 ms to 1000 ms, the algorithm accuracies increased with RF from 85% to 97% due to the increased temporal resolution. It was also noticed that the RF performed better with an accuracy of 85% than the NN with accuracy 80% when the temporal resolution was smaller, indicating the RF will be efficient when quick-response time is important. As the window size increases, the NN showed higher performance, suggesting that NN will be useful when higher accuracy is required. Future studies should increase the sample size, include more hand gestures, use different feature extraction methods and test different algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the system.',\n",
       "   \"The study aimed to investigate whether mindfulness could mitigate the impact of job and interpersonal demands arising from stressful organizational cultures in predicting depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 280 Korean physical therapists participated in this study. To verify the mediated moderation model, this study implemented an SPSS 26.0 PROCESS Macro (v.3.5) that was based on the verification of Hayes' conditional indirect effect. The study confirmed the moderated mediation effect of mindfulness on the mediating relationship between stressful organizational culture, job demands/interpersonal demands, and depression. Moreover, the conditional indirect effect of mindfulness was found to be statistically significant. However, the impact on interpersonal stress differed from anticipated outcomes. Mindfulness, applicable within the framework of the Job Demands-Resources model theory, served as a resource variable and moderated the impact of organizational culture on members' depression. Amidst ongoing debates on mindfulness effectiveness, this study partially confirmed its potential within the Job Demands-Resources model, suggesting a role in mitigating the influence of organizational culture on members' depression as a resource variable.\",\n",

In a repeated-measures laboratory study, each of the twenty participants performed standardised VR tasks with three different target sizes: small, medium, and large. During the VR tasks, biomechanical load in the neck and shoulders (joint angles, joint moments, and muscle activity), cognitive load (perceived workload and cognitive stress), and task performance (completion time) were collected. The neck and shoulder joint angles, joint moments, and muscle activities were greater with the large targets compared to the medium and small targets. Moreover, the larger VR targets caused greater temporal demand and longer task completion time compared to the other target sizes.

Methods A survey was conducted among 280 physical therapists in Korea from December 2021 to January 2022 to collect demographic information and data on job stress, depression, and mindfulness. Frequency analysis, chi-square test, cross-tabulation, correlation analysis, and analysis of variance were conducted. Results The participants exhibited a high-stress index regardless of the type of medical institution, age, and education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Job stress showed significant differences by marriage, education, work department, and depression. It was positively correlated with depression ( r = 0.527, p &lt; 0.001) and was higher among musculoskeletal physical therapists ( F = 3.710, p &lt; 0.01). Depression differed significantly by work period, job stress, and mindfulness. Although mindfulness differed significantly only by depression, it was negatively correlated with stress ( r = −0.440, p &lt; 0.001) and depression ( r = −0.525, p &lt; 0.001) and was higher among participants with graduate than undergraduate degrees ( F = 3.751, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The participants suffered from psychological instability and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, musculoskeletal physical therapists who mainly performed manual therapy exhibited higher job stress indexes compared to other divisions.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Introduction Aspergillus flavus is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus that infects oilseed crops worldwide. When colonizing plants, it produces mycotoxins, including carcinogenic compounds such as aflatoxins. Mycotoxin contamination results in an important economic and health impact. The design of new strategies to control A. flavus colonization and mycotoxin contamination is paramount. Methods The biocontrol potential of a promising new isolate of Pseudomonas spp., 20EI1 against A. flavus was assessed using bioassays and microscopy. To further elucidate the nature of this bacterial-fungal interaction, we also performed chemical and transcriptomics analyses. Results In the present study, Pseudomonas spp., 20EI1 was able to reduce the growth of A. flavus . Furthermore, we determined that this growth inhibition is iron-dependent. In addition, Pseudomonas 20EI1 reduced or blocked the production of aflatoxin, as well as cyclopiazonic acid and kojic acid. Expression of iron-related genes was altered in the presence of the bacteria and genes involved in the production of aflatoxin were down-regulated. Iron supplementation partially reestablished their expression. Expression of other secondary metabolite (SM) genes was also reduced by the bacteria, including genes of clusters involved in cyclopiazonic acid, kojic acid and imizoquin biosynthesis, while genes of the cluster corresponding to aspergillicin, a siderophore, were upregulated. Interestingly, the global SM regulatory gene mtfA was significantly upregulated by 20EI1, which could have contributed to the observed alterations in SM. Discussion Our results suggest that Pseudomonas 20EI1 is a promising biocontrol against A. flavus , and provide further insight into this iron-dependent bacterial-fungal interaction affecting the expression of numerous genes, among them those involved in SM.',\n",
       "   'Cellulose deconstruction and utilization are key to unlocking renewable fuel and chemical production. Anaerocellum bescii (formerly Caldicellulosiruptor bescii ) is an extremely thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium, among the most effective at degrading lignocellulosic biomass due to its arsenal of multi-domain cellulases and hemicellulases. However, little is known about how it transports the assorted sugars released from lignocellulose degradation into the cell for catabolism. Among its twenty-three ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) sugar transporters, the mechanism for uptake of cello-oligosaccharides released from cellulose degradation remains unclear. Here, we identify an ABC transporter locus ( Athe_0595 — 0598 ), highly conserved in the genus with two extracellular binding proteins, Athe_0597 and Athe_0598. Biophysical analyses, including Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), reveal that Athe_0597, binds cello-oligosaccharides of varying lengths (G2-5), while Athe_0598 is specific to cellobiose (G2). Computational modeling of ligand docking supports these findings and sheds light on the subsite configuration of the substrate binding proteins. To assess its physiological importance, we genetically deleted this transporter locus in A. bescii strain HTAB187, which does not grow on cellulose and grows poorly on cellobiose. Comparison of growth with a msmK deletion strain that cannot consume oligosaccharides shows that HTAB187 can grow on non-cello-oligosaccharides (e.g. maltose) or monosaccharides. Taken together, this study integrates biophysical characterization, structural modeling, and genetic perturbation to elucidate how A. bescii transports cello-oligosaccharides release from cellulose, opening doors for its future use in applied bioprocessing contexts.',\n",
       "   'ABSTRACT Velvet proteins, as well as the epigenetic regulator LaeA, are conserved in numerous fungal species, where, in response to environmental cues, they control several crucial cellular processes, including sexual and asexual morphogenesis, secondary metabolism, response to oxidative stress, and virulence. During the last two decades, knowledge of their mechanism of action as well as understanding their functional roles, has greatly increased, particularly in Aspergillus species. Research efforts from multiple groups followed, leading to the characterization of other Velvet and LaeA homologs in species of other fungal genera, including important opportunistic plant and animal pathogens. This review focuses mainly on the current knowledge of the role of Velvet and LaeA function in fungal pathogenesis. Velvet proteins and LaeA are unique to fungi, and for this reason, additional knowledge of these critical regulatory proteins will be important in the development of targeted control strategies to decrease the detrimental impact of fungal pathogens capable of causing disease in plants and animals.',\n",
       "   'ABSTRACT Homeobox domain (HD) proteins present a crucial involvement in morphological differentiation and other functions in eukaryotes. Most HD genes encode transcription factors (TFs) that orchestrate a regulatory role in cellular and developmental decisions. In fungi, multiple studies have increased our understanding of these important HD regulators in recent years. These reports have revealed their role in fungal development, both sexual and asexual, as well as their importance in governing other biological processes in these organisms, including secondary metabolism, pathogenicity, and sensitivity to environmental stresses. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current knowledge on the regulatory roles of HD-TFs in fungi, with a special focus on Aspergillus species.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['ABSTRACT We investigate the changing snowstorm landscape in eastern North America using dynamically downscaled regional climate simulations that compare the late‐20th century against mid‐ and late‐21st‐century epochs for two climate pathways that include moderate and pessimistic warming. By identifying, tracking, and cataloguing snowstorms, we illustrate how the frequency, snow water equivalent, and other features of these events may change. Results suggest changes in snowstorm characteristics are most significant for the pessimistic pathway, especially toward the late 21st century. There is similar event frequency between the historical period and mid‐21st‐century projections but declines of 3% to 10% are still projected for snowstorm counts, hours, cumulative area, and snow water equivalent. By the late 21st century, snowstorm attributes have losses of 6% to 37% versus the historical period, revealing a projected acceleration in loss from the mid to late century. Spatially, snowstorm reduction is most dramatic along and south of the Ohio River Valley as the latitude that separates steady snowstorm counts to the north and reduced snowstorms to the south migrates poleward in the future. Similarly, extreme snowstorms decline to the south, with some northern regions experiencing increase in counts and snow water equivalent, affirming prior research theorising that some snowfall may intensify as increasing moisture in a warming climate interacts with environments with temperatures still supportive of snowfall. Significant reductions in early and late cool‐season snowstorms are projected across all future epochs, revealing a shrinking season. These results provide a set of perspectives on how a dominant cryospheric input—the snowstorm—will change across eastern North America in the future.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Elevated mixed layers (EMLs) influence the severe convective storm climatology in the contiguous United States (CONUS), playing an important role in the initiation, sustenance, and suppression of storms. This study creates a high-resolution climatology of the EML to analyze variability and potential changes in EML frequency and characteristics for the first time. An objective algorithm is applied to ERA5 to detect EMLs, defined in part as layers of steep lapse rates (≥8.0°C km −1 ) at least 200 hPa thick, in the CONUS and northern Mexico from 1979 to 2021. EMLs are most frequent over the Great Plains in spring and summer, with a standard deviation of 4–10 EML days per year highlighting sizable interannual variability. Mean convective inhibition associated with the EML’s capping inversion suggests many EMLs prohibit convection, although—like nearly all EML characteristics—there is considerable spread and notable seasonal variability. In the High Plains, statistically significant increases in EML days (4–5 more days per decade) coincide with warmer EML bases and steeper EML lapse rates, driven by warming and drying in the low levels of the western CONUS during the study period. Additionally, increases in EML base temperatures result in significantly more EML-related convective inhibition over the Great Plains, which may continue to have implications for convective storm frequency, intensity, severe perils, and precipitation if this trend persists. Significance Statement Elevated mixed layers (EMLs) play a role in the spatiotemporal frequency of severe convective storms and precipitation across the contiguous United States and northern Mexico. This research creates a detailed EML climatology from a modern reanalysis dataset to uncover patterns and potential changes in EML frequency and associated meteorological characteristics. EMLs are most common over the Great Plains in spring and summer, but show significant variability year-to-year. Robust increases in the number of days with EMLs have occurred since 1979 across the High Plains. Lapse rates associated with EMLs have trended steeper, in part due to warmer EML base temperatures. This has resulted in increasing EML convective inhibition, which has important implications for regional climate.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Short-duration, high-intensity rainfall can initiate deadly and destructive debris flows after wildfire. Methods to estimate the conditions that can trigger debris flows exist and guidance to determine how often those thresholds will be exceeded under the present climate are available. However, the limited spatiotemporal resolution of climate models has hampered efforts to characterize how rainfall intensification driven by global warming may affect debris-flow hazards. We use novel, dynamically downscaled (3.75-km), convection-permitting simulations of short-duration (15-min) rainfall to evaluate threshold exceedance for late 21st-century climate scenarios in the American Southwest. We observe significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of exceedances for regions dominated by cool- and warm-season rainfall. We also observe an increased frequency of exceedance in regions where postfire debris flows have not been documented, and communities are unaccustomed to the hazard. Our findings can inform planning efforts to increase resiliency to debris flows under a changing climate.',\n",
       "   'Hailstorms are analyzed across the United States using explicit hailstone size calculations from convection-permitting regional climate simulations for historical, mid-century, and end of twenty-first-century epochs. Near-surface hailstones <4 cm are found to decrease in frequency by an average of 25%, whereas the largest stones are found to increase by 15–75% depending on the greenhouse gas emissions pathway. Decreases in the frequency of near-surface severe hail days are expected across the U.S. High Plains, with 2–4 fewer days projected—primarily in summer. Column-maximum severe hail days are projected to increase robustly in most locations outside of the southern Plains, a distribution that closely mimics projections of thunderstorm days. Primary mechanisms for the changes in hailstone size are linked to future environments supportive of greater instability opposed by thicker melting layers. This results in a future hailstone size dichotomy, whereby stronger updrafts promote more of the largest hailstones, but significant decreases occur for a majority of smaller diameters due to increased melting.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract This research seeks to understand simulated supercell precipitation characteristics across the conterminous United States (CONUS) using high‐resolution, convection‐permitting, dynamically downscaled simulations for three 15‐year epochs. Epochs include a historical end‐of‐20th‐century period (1990–2005) and two end‐of‐21st‐century (2085–2100) scenarios for intermediate and pessimistic greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Simulated updraft helicity, which measures the corkscrew flow within a storm's updraft, is used as a proxy for supercells. An algorithm tracks and catalogues updraft helicity swaths that, when buffered, are used to acquire simulated precipitation from supercells. The historical epoch provides a baseline climatology of supercell precipitation for a contemporary climate, which is then compared against the two future epochs to assess how supercell precipitation may change during the 21st century. Despite their relatively small size, supercells provide critical precipitation to the Wheat and Corn Belts, large expanses of CONUS pasture and rangeland, regional aquifers and several large river basins. Many areas in the central CONUS receive upwards of 3%–6% of their annual and 5%–8% of their warm‐season precipitation from these storms. Results suggest that precipitation contribution from supercells will decrease in the future across most of the High Plains and Central and Northern Great Plains with robust increases likely across the south‐central and Southeast regions. Supercell precipitation rates are expected to increase for large portions of the CONUS by the end‐of‐the‐21st‐century, suggesting a growing threat for flash floods from these storms as they become more efficient precipitation producers. This research provides an initial perspective on the magnitude of supercell precipitation and potential changes to this important hydrologic input to assist water‐sensitive industries, private and public insurance markets, agriculture entities, as well as inform plans to mitigate and build resilience to rapid environmental and societal change.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract The potential for changes in extreme precipitation events due to anthropogenic climate change may have significant societal impacts (e.g., agricultural productivity, property loss, mortality). This project uses a dynamically downscaled, convection-permitting regional climate model to investigate extreme daily precipitation in the CONUS, defined explicitly as the 99th percentile 24-h accumulated value. The simulation output includes a historical baseline (HIST; 1990–2005) and two epochs at the end of the twenty-first century (EOC; 2085–2100) under intermediate and pessimistic emissions scenarios. Independent observations illustrate that HIST admirably represents extreme precipitation climatology for most locations in the domain. Comparisons between HIST and the two EOC scenarios for the 99th percentile of daily precipitation show statistically significant increases during Dec–May across the Midwest and Ohio Valley and statistically significant decreases for the southern Great Plains during Dec–Feb. Extreme value analysis further reveals increasing variability in precipitation extremes for eight climatologically unique cities across the CONUS by the end of the twenty-first century and significant increases in return period precipitation amounts for most cities examined. These results provide additional guidance for stakeholders to reduce societal impacts and economic loss from daily precipitation extremes and create a more climate-resilient society.',\n",

       "   'AI data-driven models (Graphcast, Pangu Weather, Fourcastnet, and SFNO) are explored for storyline-based climate attribution due to their short inference times, which can accelerate the number of events studied, and provide real time attributions when public attention is heightened. The analysis is framed on the extreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the Oroville dam spillway incident in Northern California. Past and future simulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the pre-industrial and the late-21st century temperature climate change signals, respectively. The simulations are compared to results from a dynamical model which represents plausible pseudo-realities under both climate environments. Overall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5-6 % increase in the integrated water vapor over the Oroville dam in the present day compared to the pre-industrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different geopotential-moisture-temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the AI-models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the physicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to simulate weaker attribution values than the pseudo-reality imagined by the dynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for the late-21st century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model (>500 members) produced statistically significant present-day to pre-industrial attribution results, unlike the >20-member ensemble from the dynamical model. This analysis highlights the potential of AI models to conduct attribution analysis, while emphasizing future lines of work on explainable artificial intelligence to gain confidence in these tools, which can enable reliable attribution studies in real-time.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Changes in the frequency and intensity of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are assessed using convection-permitting regional climate model simulations. We present a novel classification method that relates MCSs to the magnitude of their large-scale forcing environments to better understand the changing nature of MCSs across different forcing environments in a possible future climate scenario. Overall, the annual frequency, intensity, and amount of precipitation associated with MCSs are projected to increase for broad portions of the eastern conterminous United States (CONUS). Furthermore, changes in the characteristics of MCSs show larger, longer-lived, and faster MCSs particularly over the Midwest and Southeast. Seasonal examination of this response reveals a robust intensification of March–May (MAM) MCSs. The higher frequency of MAM MCSs are found to occur in weakly forced synoptic environments. Increased rainfall amounts are explained by an intensification of MCSs due to changing thermodynamics and enhanced lower-tropospheric moisture transport into the central CONUS by the North Atlantic Subtropical High. Differences in mid-latitude storm tracks are favorable towards the enhanced development of MCSs associated with strong baroclinic forcing within the Midwest and Northern Plains, but are only realized in the presence of strong changes in lower-tropospheric moisture transport. Overall, these results suggest a shift in the behavior of MAM MCSs that more closely corresponds to the behavior of June–August (JJA) MCSs in the historical climate. The increased occurrence of MCSs in weakly forced environments, particularly in MAM, deserves further investigation.',\n",
       "   'Abstract An important source of errors in predicting landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs), and their associated extreme precipitation and streamflow, are inaccuracies in model initial conditions in ARs offshore. These inaccuracies are particularly evident in the marine boundary layer (MBL) where the tendency of ARs to transport warm air poleward over progressively cooler SSTs generates a stable MBL (SMBL). The SMBL’s vertical structure and key modulating processes are documented using &gt;1000 dropsondes along 99 transects of ARs from the AR Reconnaissance and CalWater field campaigns. The SMBL depth, modulated by sensible heat loss to the ocean, is typically 300–800 m in the AR core, with vertical wind shears ranging from 5–50 m s −1 km −1 , representing a highly variable decoupling of the AR aloft from conditions at the ocean surface. Simulated backward air parcel trajectories originating from dropsonde locations within the AR core are used to calculate the 24-h change in SST experienced by an air parcel (DSST24) beneath each AR. The DSST24 varies from −13°C to +2°C and is directly related to the strength of the AR and its orientation relative to the SST gradient. The DSST24, therefore, distinguishes weak and strong decoupling regimes (WDR, SDR). In SDR cases, relative to WDR cases, the SMBL is characterized by greater sensible heat loss to the ocean, as well as stronger static stability, vertical wind shear, low-level jet, and horizontal water vapor transport. In SDR cases, the SMBL is deeper in the core than in adjacent warm and cold sectors.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Hyperfine energy levels in trapped ions offer long-lived spin states. In addition, the motion of these charged particles couples strongly to external electric field perturbations. These characteristics make trapped ions attractive platforms for the quantum sensing of electric fields. However, the spin states do not exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling to electric fields. This limits the achievable sensitivities. Here, we amplify the coupling between electric field perturbations and the spin states by using a static magnetic field gradient. Displacements of the trapped ion resulting from the forces experienced by an applied external electric field perturbation are thereby mapped to an instantaneous change in the energy level splitting of the internal spin states. This gradient mediated coupling of the electric field to the spin enables the use of a range of well-established magnetometry protocols for electrometry. Using our quantum sensor, we demonstrate AC sensitivities of $\\\\mathrm{S^{AC}_{min}=960(10)\\\\times 10^{-6}~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}$ at a signal frequency of $\\\\omega_{\\\\epsilon}/2\\\\pi=5.82~\\\\mathrm{Hz}$, and DC sensitivities of $\\\\mathrm{S^{DC}_{min}=1.97(3)\\\\times 10^{-3} ~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}}$ with a Hahn-echo type sensing sequence. We also employ a rotating frame relaxometry technique, with which our quantum sensor can be utilised as an electric field noise spectrum analyser. We measure electric field signals down to a noise floor of $\\\\mathrm{S_{E}(\\\\omega)=6.2(5)\\\\times 10^{-12}~V^2 m^{-2}Hz^{-1}}$ at a frequency of $\\\\mathrm{30.0(3)~kHz}$. We therefore demonstrate unprecedented electric field sensitivities for the measurement of both DC signals and AC signals across a frequency range of sub-Hz to $\\\\sim\\\\mathrm{500~kHz}$. Finally, we describe a set of hardware modifications that are capable of achieving a further improvement in sensitivity by up to six orders of magnitude.'],\n",

We first present results concerning Clarke's generalized Jacobian of the projection onto a closed and convex cone. We then describe the iterative process for the general cone case and establish two convergence theorems. We apply these results to the constrained quadratic conic programming problem, emphasizing its connection to the projection equation. To illustrate the performance of our method, we conduct numerical experiments focusing on semidefinite least squares, in particular the nearest correlation matrix problem. In the latter scenario, we benchmark our outcomes against previous literature, presenting performance profiles and tabulated results for clarity and comparison.\",\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce disruptions in a wide range of cognitive functions, but it is especially detrimental to spatial navigation. In open environments, rodents organize their spatial behaviors around centralized locations, termed home bases, from which they make circuitous and slow locomotor trips (progressions) into the rest of the environment. Open-field behaviors are organized even under darkened test conditions, suggesting a role for self-motion cues (vestibular, motor, etc.). The impact of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (mPAE) on the organization of spontaneous open-field behaviors under darkened conditions has not been investigated. Here we tested adult female and male rats with mPAE or saccharin control exposure in a circular open field for 30 min in a testing room that was made completely dark. While general locomotion, as measured by reductions in travel distance and increased stop duration, decreased across the test session, the organization of these behaviors, as measured by stop duration, home base establishment, home base stability, progression accuracy, and scaling of peak speeds with progression length, did not differ between mPAE and saccharin control rats. Together, the findings strongly suggest that spontaneous movement organization in relation to self-motion cues remains intact in adult mPAE rats.

       "   'Although the specific relationship between concussion and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) has not been fully elucidated, it is generally understood that the pathologic response after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is linked with systolic cardiac dysfunction. In this case, we present a patient with multiple concussion injuries over a five-year period who exhibited severe cardiac and autonomic dysfunction, in addition to prolonged impairments in vestibular function, oculomotor function, cognitive function, and headaches. The patient is a 28-year-old male with a past medical history of multiple concussions, with the first concussion occurring due to a skiing accident in January 2015. He initially presented in October 2016 after sustaining a concussion due to a motor vehicle accident (MVA) without loss of consciousness (LOC) two weeks prior. In July 2017, the patient was involved in another MVA with a positive head strike and without LOC, causing his third concussion. After each of his first three concussions, he displayed various symptoms that eventually resolved. In October 2020, the patient suffered a syncopal ground-level fall with several minutes of LOC due to dehydration and lightheadedness, leading to his fourth concussion. His fourth concussion resulted in chronic autonomic dysfunction with resting tachycardia refractory to medical management, and he eventually underwent a cardiac ablation. Although the patient underwent a cardiac ablation, his tachycardia and dysautonomia still cause dysfunction in his daily life. With millions of people living with the sequelae of TBI, the recognition and treatment of autonomic dysfunction should be a continued focus in brain injury research.',\n",

The research focuses on three key questions: identifying the frequently discussed topics in youth research that receive citations in policy documents, discerning patterns in youth research that contribute to higher citation rates in policy, and comparing the alignment between topics in youth research and those in citing policy documents. Through this analysis, the study aims to shed light on the relationship between academic research and policy formulation, highlighting areas where youth issues are effectively integrated into policy and contributing to the broader goal of enhancing youth engagement in societal decision-making processes.',\n",
       "   'Ultrasonic testing is a common Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) method used in aerospace manufacturing. However, the complexity and size of the ultrasonic scans make it challenging to identify defects through visual inspection or machine learning models. Using computer vision techniques to identify defects from ultrasonic scans is an evolving research area. In this study, we used instance segmentation to identify the presence of defects in the ultrasonic scan images of composite panels that are representative of real components manufactured in aerospace. We used two models based on Mask-RCNN (Detectron 2) and YOLO 11 respectively. Additionally, we implemented a simple statistical pre-processing technique that reduces the burden of requiring custom-tailored pre-processing techniques. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using instance segmentation in the NDI pipeline by significantly reducing data pre-processing time, inspection time, and overall costs.',\n",

       "   'Human saliva contains a wealth of proteins that can be monitored for disease diagnosis and progression. Saliva, which is easy to collect, has been extensively studied for the diagnosis of numerous systemic and infectious diseases. However, the presence of amylase, the most abundant protein in saliva, can obscure the detection of low-abundance proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS), thus reducing its diagnostic utility. In this study, we used a device to deplete salivary amylase from water-gargle samples by affinity adsorption. Following depletion, saliva proteome profiling was performed using MALDI-ToF MS on gargle samples from individuals confirmed to have COVID-19 based on nasopharyngeal (NP) swab reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The depletion of amylase led to increased signal intensities of various peaks and the detection of previously unobserved peaks in the MALDI-ToF MS spectra. The overall specificity and sensitivity after amylase depletion were 100% and 85.17%, respectively, for detecting COVID-19. This simple, rapid, and inexpensive technique for depleting salivary amylase can reveal spectral diversity in saliva using MALDI-ToF MS, expose low-abundance proteins, and assist in establishing novel biomarkers for diseases.',\n",
       "   'The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant weaknesses in the healthcare information system. The overwhelming volume of misinformation on social media and other socioeconomic factors created extraordinary challenges to motivate people to take proper precautions and get vaccinated. In this context, our work explored a novel direction by analyzing an extensive dataset collected over two years, identifying the topics de/motivating the public about COVID-19 vaccination. We analyzed these topics based on time, geographic location, and political orientation. We noticed that while the motivating topics remain the same over time and geographic location, the demotivating topics rapidly. We also identified that intrinsic motivation, rather than external mandate, is more advantageous to inspire the public. This study addresses scientific communication and public motivation in social media. It can help public health officials, policymakers, and social media platforms develop more effective messaging strategies to cut through the noise of misinformation and educate the public about scientific findings.',\n",
       "   'Purpose With the remarkable capability to reach the public instantly, social media has become integral in sharing scholarly articles to measure public response. Since spamming by bots on social media can steer the conversation and present a false public interest in given research, affecting policies impacting the public’s lives in the real world, this topic warrants critical study and attention. Design/methodology/approach We used the Altmetric dataset in combination with data collected through the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) and the Botometer API. We combined the data into an extensive dataset with academic articles, several features from the article and a label indicating whether the article had excessive bot activity on Twitter or not. We analyzed the data to see the possibility of bot activity based on different characteristics of the article. We also trained machine-learning models using this dataset to identify possible bot activity in any given article. Findings Our machine-learning models were capable of identifying possible bot activity in any academic article with an accuracy of 0.70. We also found that articles related to “Health and Human Science” are more prone to bot activity compared to other research areas. Without arguing the maliciousness of the bot activity, our work presents a tool to identify the presence of bot activity in the dissemination of an academic article and creates a baseline for future research in this direction. Research limitations/implications We considered the features available from the Altmetric dataset. It can be exciting research to extract additional features about the authors of the article, the location of the publication, international collaboration and other demographic features of the authors to see the relation of these features with bot activity. Practical implications Since public interest in scientific findings can shape the decisions of policymakers, it is essential to identify the possibility of bot activity in the dissemination of any given scholarly article. Without arguing whether the social bots are good or bad and without arguing about the validity of a scholarly article, our work proposes a tool to interpret the public interest in an article by identifying the possibility of bot activity toward an article. This work publishes the models and data generated through the study and provides a benchmark and guideline for future works in this direction. Originality/value While the majority of the existing research focuses on identifying and preventing bot activity on social media, our work is novel in predicting the possibility of bot activity in the dissemination of an academic article using Altmetric metadata for the article. Little work has been performed in this specific area, and the models developed from our research give policymakers and the public a tool to interpret and understand the public interest in a scientific publication with appropriate caution.',\n",
       "   \"The reproducibility of scientific articles is central to the advancement of science. Despite this importance, evaluating reproducibility remains challenging due to the scarcity of ground truth data. Predictive models can address this limitation by streamlining the tedious evaluation process. Typically, a paper's reproducibility is inferred based on the availability of artifacts such as code, data, or supplemental information, often without extensive empirical investigation. To address these issues, we utilized artifacts of papers as fundamental units to develop a novel, dual-spectrum framework that focuses on author-centric and external-agent perspectives. We used the author-centric spectrum, followed by the external-agent spectrum, to guide a structured, model-based approach to quantify and assess reproducibility. We explored the interdependencies between different factors influencing reproducibility and found that linguistic features such as readability and lexical diversity are strongly correlated with papers achieving the highest statuses on both spectrums. Our work provides a model-driven pathway for evaluating the reproducibility of scientific research.

We tested the effectiveness of using a task-model steps chart to help students understand, evaluate, and use theories presented in their introductory psychology textbook and lecture videos. We randomly assigned 52 undergraduates enrolled in an asynchronous online introductory psychology course to either the task-model steps chart (experimental) or a business-as-usual assignment (control) section of the course. The outcome measures were Exams 2 and 3 and applied-summary activities. Results demonstrated that although scores were not different between the two conditions at the middle of the course (Exam 2), students in the experimental condition performed better than students in the control condition on Exam 3 on non-targeted (transfer) items and the applied summaries. This study provides initial evidence of the value of supporting students’ disciplinary-specific understanding of the role of theories and studies in psychology. This task-model steps chart is a general tool that can be adapted to help introductory students read and think in psychology.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service general crop condition data are used to quantify the relationship between crop conditions and yield, condition tendencies during the growing season, how conditions vary across the United States, and how conditions have trended for the 1986–2022 period for a variety of crops: barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), corn ( Zea mays L.), cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), oats ( Avena sativa L.), peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea L.), rice ( Oryza sativa L.), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L.), soybeans ( Glycine max L.), and spring and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Crop conditions are a statistically significant covariate (90% significance level) for yield and can be used in practice on a weekly basis. This becomes increasingly important as, historically, crop conditions not only deteriorated on average, but also became more variable throughout the growing season. Spatial differences in conditions, variability, and trends in condition ratings and variability are caused by crop selection, regional climate, and management practices such as irrigation. Crop conditions were poorest and had the highest interannual variability across the southern Great Plains region. Since 1986, crop conditions in the Great Plains region have deteriorated significantly, while variability has increased. Meanwhile, crop conditions across the southwestern and southeastern United States have significantly improved, while interannual variability in conditions has experienced robust declines. Given climatic and hydrologic trends, to maintain a positive trend in yield, continued advancements in production management and technology are required. Critical decisions regarding real‐time or future management can be supplemented by using crop condition risk assessment information along with actively monitoring weekly conditions.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Although they are the first involved in emergency response, 9-1-1 public safety communicators (PSCs) are largely excluded from studies on the effects of repeated exposure to duty-related traumatic events. Studies have shown that 9-1-1 PSCs experience negative health outcomes, including posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). This study aimed to understand the relationship between social support, world assumptions (e.g., beliefs regarding benevolence of the world, benevolence of people, and self-worth), and PTSS in 221 9-1-1 PSCs across the United States in a 1-year longitudinal study. Social support was positively associated with world assumptions but negatively associated with PTSS, and PTSS were negatively related to world assumptions. Mediation models revealed that world assumptions at 6 months had indirect effects on the association between baseline social support and PTSS 1 year later. This study supports current conceptualizations of posttraumatic stress disorder and trauma treatments focused on identifying and challenging maladaptive beliefs. It may be beneficial to explore how public safety personnel's world assumptions impact their likelihood of reaching out for support. Because social support is largely associated with PTSS through people's assumptions about the world, other people, and themselves, interventions targeting world assumptions might be particularly advantageous for this population.

       "   'The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 global pandemic has exhibited a striking capacity for viral evolution that drives continued evasion from vaccine and infection-induced immune responses. Mutations in the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein have led to considerable escape from antibody responses, reducing the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies. Therefore, there is a need to interrogate more constrained regions of spike, such as the S2 subdomain. Here, we present a collection of S2 mAbs from two SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals that target multiple regions in S2, including regions outside of those commonly reported. One of the S2 mAbs, C20.119, which bound to a highly conserved epitope in the fusion peptide, was able to broadly neutralize across SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1, and closely related zoonotic sarbecoviruses. The majority of the mAbs were non-neutralizing; however, many of them could mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) at levels similar to the S1-targeting mAb S309 that was previously authorized for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several of the mAbs with ADCC function also bound to spike trimers from other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as MERS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1. Our findings suggest S2 mAbs can target diverse epitopes in S2, including functional mAbs with HCoV and sarbecovirus breadth that likely target functionally constrained regions of spike. These mAbs could be developed for potential future pandemics, while also providing insight into ideal epitopes for eliciting a broad HCoV response.',\n",

Therefore, there is a need to interrogate more constrained regions of Spike, such as the S2 subdomain. Here, we describe a collection of S2 mAbs from two SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals that target multiple regions in the S2 subdomain and can be grouped into at least five epitope classes. Most did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with the exception of C20.119, which bound to a highly conserved epitope in the fusion peptide and showed broad binding and neutralization activity across SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and closely related zoonotic sarbecoviruses. Several of the S2 mAbs tested mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) at levels similar to the S1 mAb S309 that was previously authorized for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

       "   'The recurring spillover of pathogenic coronaviruses and demonstrated capacity of sarbecoviruses, such SARS-CoV-2, to rapidly evolve in humans underscores the need to better understand immune responses to this virus family. For this purpose, we characterized the functional breadth and potency of antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein that exhibited cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1 and sarbecoviruses from diverse clades and animal origins with spillover potential. One neutralizing antibody, C68.61, showed remarkable neutralization breadth against both SARS-CoV-2 variants and viruses from different sarbecovirus clades. C68.61, which targets a conserved RBD class 5 epitope, did not select for escape variants of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 in culture nor have predicted escape variants among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting this epitope is functionally constrained. We identified 11 additional SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV-1 cross-reactive antibodies that target the more sequence conserved class 4 and class 5 epitopes within RBD that show activity against a subset of diverse sarbecoviruses with one antibody binding every single sarbecovirus RBD tested. A subset of these antibodies exhibited Fc-mediated effector functions as potent as antibodies that impact infection outcome in animal models. Thus, our study identified antibodies targeting conserved regions across SARS-CoV-2 variants and sarbecoviruses that may serve as therapeutics for pandemic preparedness as well as blueprints for the design of immunogens capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing responses.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract Opening with discussion of a monument that marked the centennial of Walt Whitman’s 1819 birth, this chapter interrogates Whitman’s engagements with hieroglyphic antiquity, excavating the graphic and alphabetic inscriptions that lie underneath Leaves of Grass. In 1920, lines from Leaves of Grass were inscribed in massive letters on a Canadian cliff overlooking Mazinaw Lake in traditional Algonquian territory. Now, a full hundred years later, these inscribed words have eroded but are still faintly legible, aptly reflecting tensions original to Whitman’s own poetry, spanning organic grass and effaced granite, English language and Anishinaabe lands. The chapter argues that Whitman’s verses—rightly associated with leafy animation and serene leisure —are also rooted in a nineteenth century typified by archaeological discovery and deciphering, with Leaves of Grass growing from the granite and clay grounds of pre-Columbian America and Bronze Age Assyria, bridging between Indigenous petroglyphs and Near Eastern cuneiform tablets.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['ABSTRACT We investigate the changing snowstorm landscape in eastern North America using dynamically downscaled regional climate simulations that compare the late‐20th century against mid‐ and late‐21st‐century epochs for two climate pathways that include moderate and pessimistic warming. By identifying, tracking, and cataloguing snowstorms, we illustrate how the frequency, snow water equivalent, and other features of these events may change. Results suggest changes in snowstorm characteristics are most significant for the pessimistic pathway, especially toward the late 21st century. There is similar event frequency between the historical period and mid‐21st‐century projections but declines of 3% to 10% are still projected for snowstorm counts, hours, cumulative area, and snow water equivalent. By the late 21st century, snowstorm attributes have losses of 6% to 37% versus the historical period, revealing a projected acceleration in loss from the mid to late century. Spatially, snowstorm reduction is most dramatic along and south of the Ohio River Valley as the latitude that separates steady snowstorm counts to the north and reduced snowstorms to the south migrates poleward in the future. Similarly, extreme snowstorms decline to the south, with some northern regions experiencing increase in counts and snow water equivalent, affirming prior research theorising that some snowfall may intensify as increasing moisture in a warming climate interacts with environments with temperatures still supportive of snowfall. Significant reductions in early and late cool‐season snowstorms are projected across all future epochs, revealing a shrinking season. These results provide a set of perspectives on how a dominant cryospheric input—the snowstorm—will change across eastern North America in the future.',\n",
       "   \"Changes in the properties of severe climatic events like rainstorms and droughts are expected to impact erosion rates significantly under modern global warming. Also over the recent geologic past and especially in drylands catchments, hydrological and vegetation transitions following changes in spatiotemporal properties of climatic phenomena have been suggested as triggers for periods of enhanced erosion that affected societies' sustainability and left pronounced topographic imprints. However, these potential drivers remain incompletely understood and quantified. This is, in part, because the discrete events that trigger erosion are hard to observe and the fine-scale processes needed to model erosion are computationally intensive to run over landscape evolution timescales.To address this, we developed a new catchment-scale landscape evolution model based on the Landlab toolkit that explicitly represents episodic failures, sub-minute hydrology, overland-driven sediment transport, and erosion-vegetation links. We validated the model against event-based runoff and sediment records from the Lucky Hills site in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona, USA. After validation, we conducted a set of stochastic numerical experiments of landscape evolution in response to changes in sub-daily rainfall distribution, without considering changes in vegetation properties. We ran an additional set of simulations that integrated the landscape evolution model with historical and future climate records for the High Plains of Colorado, driven by a convection-permitting weather model (CPM). This experimental set allows us to explore changes in vegetation cover and its influence on sediment yield and topographic evolution under modern global warming.We found that changes in the tail of the sub-daily rainfall distribution&amp;#8212;changes similar to recent observations under modern global warming&amp;#8212;could raise the total sediment yield by ~40% and alter the catchment morphology. Modeled sediment yield increased in response to the rising frequency of rare, high-magnitude storms, even when there was no significant change in the mean storm properties or annual rainfall. Further, we found that catchment erosion could increase even under a reduction in the mean conditions if the sub-daily rainfall distribution shifted toward a heavier tail. Numerical experiments driven by the CPM data confirm that under projected future conditions in the High Plains, erosion is expected to increase, even though the mean conditions become drier. Our simulations also reveal that the presence of vegetation impacts the morphology of the catchment, reducing channel density and preserving gullies' headcuts. Overall, this study contributes insight into the role of rainstorm properties and vegetation cover on landscape evolution, illuminates potential climatic triggers for past aggradation and degradation stages in low-order catchments, and provides valuable information for erosion risks under anthropogenic climatic and environmental changes.\",\n",

       "   \"Abstract Precise, accurate, and reliable crop condition data continues to be in demand for farmers, agribusiness, government agencies, agroclimatologists, and research institutions. This study evaluated the data quality of four major United States field crops: corn ( Zea mays L.), cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), soybeans ( Glycine max L.), and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's (NASS) Gridded Crop Progress and Condition dataset. Upon aggregating the weekly 9 km gridded data to the county level (and further to the state and national level) over the 2015–2023 period, no statistically significant differences emerged between the gridded condition data and the tabular condition data from the USDA NASS Crop Progress and Condition Report (CPCR). In line with state and national‐level analyses, a strong linear relationship between crop conditions and yield existed at the county scale. County‐level crop condition ratings were a statistically significant covariate of yield during the critical reproduction period through harvest for 90% of corn, 78% of cotton, 90% of soybean, and 96% of winter wheat‐producing counties. In addition, intramonthly county‐level crop conditions changed accordingly based on the magnitude of temperature and precipitation anomalies during certain phenological stages. In at least 80% of counties for each respective crop, temperatures and precipitation were statistically significant covariates for crop condition changes. The relationships between USDA NASS gridded crop condition data, CPCR data, yield, and climate substantiate the utility and fidelity of this dataset as a representation of confidential crop condition reports, supporting its practical application in research and operational decision‐making.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Elevated mixed layers (EMLs) influence the severe convective storm climatology in the contiguous United States (CONUS), playing an important role in the initiation, sustenance, and suppression of storms. This study creates a high-resolution climatology of the EML to analyze variability and potential changes in EML frequency and characteristics for the first time. An objective algorithm is applied to ERA5 to detect EMLs, defined in part as layers of steep lapse rates (≥8.0°C km −1 ) at least 200 hPa thick, in the CONUS and northern Mexico from 1979 to 2021. EMLs are most frequent over the Great Plains in spring and summer, with a standard deviation of 4–10 EML days per year highlighting sizable interannual variability. Mean convective inhibition associated with the EML’s capping inversion suggests many EMLs prohibit convection, although—like nearly all EML characteristics—there is considerable spread and notable seasonal variability. In the High Plains, statistically significant increases in EML days (4–5 more days per decade) coincide with warmer EML bases and steeper EML lapse rates, driven by warming and drying in the low levels of the western CONUS during the study period. Additionally, increases in EML base temperatures result in significantly more EML-related convective inhibition over the Great Plains, which may continue to have implications for convective storm frequency, intensity, severe perils, and precipitation if this trend persists. Significance Statement Elevated mixed layers (EMLs) play a role in the spatiotemporal frequency of severe convective storms and precipitation across the contiguous United States and northern Mexico. This research creates a detailed EML climatology from a modern reanalysis dataset to uncover patterns and potential changes in EML frequency and associated meteorological characteristics. EMLs are most common over the Great Plains in spring and summer, but show significant variability year-to-year. Robust increases in the number of days with EMLs have occurred since 1979 across the High Plains. Lapse rates associated with EMLs have trended steeper, in part due to warmer EML base temperatures. This has resulted in increasing EML convective inhibition, which has important implications for regional climate.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Short-duration, high-intensity rainfall can initiate deadly and destructive debris flows after wildfire. Methods to estimate the conditions that can trigger debris flows exist and guidance to determine how often those thresholds will be exceeded under the present climate are available. However, the limited spatiotemporal resolution of climate models has hampered efforts to characterize how rainfall intensification driven by global warming may affect debris-flow hazards. We use novel, dynamically downscaled (3.75-km), convection-permitting simulations of short-duration (15-min) rainfall to evaluate threshold exceedance for late 21st-century climate scenarios in the American Southwest. We observe significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of exceedances for regions dominated by cool- and warm-season rainfall. We also observe an increased frequency of exceedance in regions where postfire debris flows have not been documented, and communities are unaccustomed to the hazard. Our findings can inform planning efforts to increase resiliency to debris flows under a changing climate.',\n",
       "   'Hailstorms are analyzed across the United States using explicit hailstone size calculations from convection-permitting regional climate simulations for historical, mid-century, and end of twenty-first-century epochs. Near-surface hailstones <4 cm are found to decrease in frequency by an average of 25%, whereas the largest stones are found to increase by 15–75% depending on the greenhouse gas emissions pathway. Decreases in the frequency of near-surface severe hail days are expected across the U.S. High Plains, with 2–4 fewer days projected—primarily in summer. Column-maximum severe hail days are projected to increase robustly in most locations outside of the southern Plains, a distribution that closely mimics projections of thunderstorm days. Primary mechanisms for the changes in hailstone size are linked to future environments supportive of greater instability opposed by thicker melting layers. This results in a future hailstone size dichotomy, whereby stronger updrafts promote more of the largest hailstones, but significant decreases occur for a majority of smaller diameters due to increased melting.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Tornado risk, as determined by the occurrence of atmospheric conditions that support tornado incidence, has exhibited robust spatial trends in the United States Southern Plains and Mid-South during recent decades. The consequences of these risk changes have not been fully explored, especially in conjunction with growing societal vulnerability. Herein, we assess how changes in risk and vulnerability over the last 40 years have collectively and individually altered tornado-housing impact potential. Results indicate that escalating vulnerability and exposure have outweighed the effects of spatially changing risk. However, the combination of increasing risk and exposure has led to a threefold increase in Mid-South housing exposure since 1980. Though Southern Plains tornado risk has decreased since 1980, amplifying exposure has led to more than a 50% increase in mean annual tornado-housing impact potential across the region. Stakeholders should use these findings to develop more holistic mitigation and resilience-building strategies that consider a dynamically changing tornado disaster landscape.',\n",
       "   'Abstract USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service general crop condition data are used to quantify the relationship between crop conditions and yield, condition tendencies during the growing season, how conditions vary across the United States, and how conditions have trended for the 1986–2022 period for a variety of crops: barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), corn ( Zea mays L.), cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), oats ( Avena sativa L.), peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea L.), rice ( Oryza sativa L.), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L.), soybeans ( Glycine max L.), and spring and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Crop conditions are a statistically significant covariate (90% significance level) for yield and can be used in practice on a weekly basis. This becomes increasingly important as, historically, crop conditions not only deteriorated on average, but also became more variable throughout the growing season. Spatial differences in conditions, variability, and trends in condition ratings and variability are caused by crop selection, regional climate, and management practices such as irrigation. Crop conditions were poorest and had the highest interannual variability across the southern Great Plains region. Since 1986, crop conditions in the Great Plains region have deteriorated significantly, while variability has increased. Meanwhile, crop conditions across the southwestern and southeastern United States have significantly improved, while interannual variability in conditions has experienced robust declines. Given climatic and hydrologic trends, to maintain a positive trend in yield, continued advancements in production management and technology are required. Critical decisions regarding real‐time or future management can be supplemented by using crop condition risk assessment information along with actively monitoring weekly conditions.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Tornadoes in Chile seem to develop in what are called “high-shear, low-CAPE” (HSLC) environments. An analysis of convective parameters from the ERA5 reanalysis during 16 notable tornadoes in Chile showed that several increased markedly before the time of the reports. The significant tornado parameter (STP) was able to discriminate the timing and location of the tornadoes, even though it was not created with that goal. We established thresholds for the severe hazards in environments with reduced buoyancy (SHERBE) parameter (≥1) and the STP (≤−0.3) to further identify days favorable for tornado activity in Chile. The SHERBE and STP parameters were then used to conduct a climatological analysis from 1959 to 2021 of the seasonal, interannual, and latitudinal variations of the environments that might favor tornadoes. Both parameters were found to have a strong annual cycle. The largest magnitudes of STP were found to be generally confined to south-central Chile, in agreement with the (sparse) tornado record. The probability of a day with both SHERBE and STP values beyond their thresholds was greatest between May and August, which aligns with the months with the most tornado reports. The number of days with both SHERBE and STP beyond their respective thresholds was found to fluctuate interannually. This result warrants further study given the known interannual variability of synoptic and mesoscale weather in Chile. The results of this study extend our understanding of tornado environments in Chile and provide insight into their spatiotemporal variability.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract This research seeks to understand simulated supercell precipitation characteristics across the conterminous United States (CONUS) using high‐resolution, convection‐permitting, dynamically downscaled simulations for three 15‐year epochs. Epochs include a historical end‐of‐20th‐century period (1990–2005) and two end‐of‐21st‐century (2085–2100) scenarios for intermediate and pessimistic greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Simulated updraft helicity, which measures the corkscrew flow within a storm's updraft, is used as a proxy for supercells. An algorithm tracks and catalogues updraft helicity swaths that, when buffered, are used to acquire simulated precipitation from supercells. The historical epoch provides a baseline climatology of supercell precipitation for a contemporary climate, which is then compared against the two future epochs to assess how supercell precipitation may change during the 21st century. Despite their relatively small size, supercells provide critical precipitation to the Wheat and Corn Belts, large expanses of CONUS pasture and rangeland, regional aquifers and several large river basins. Many areas in the central CONUS receive upwards of 3%–6% of their annual and 5%–8% of their warm‐season precipitation from these storms. Results suggest that precipitation contribution from supercells will decrease in the future across most of the High Plains and Central and Northern Great Plains with robust increases likely across the south‐central and Southeast regions. Supercell precipitation rates are expected to increase for large portions of the CONUS by the end‐of‐the‐21st‐century, suggesting a growing threat for flash floods from these storms as they become more efficient precipitation producers. This research provides an initial perspective on the magnitude of supercell precipitation and potential changes to this important hydrologic input to assist water‐sensitive industries, private and public insurance markets, agriculture entities, as well as inform plans to mitigate and build resilience to rapid environmental and societal change.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract The potential for changes in extreme precipitation events due to anthropogenic climate change may have significant societal impacts (e.g., agricultural productivity, property loss, mortality). This project uses a dynamically downscaled, convection-permitting regional climate model to investigate extreme daily precipitation in the CONUS, defined explicitly as the 99th percentile 24-h accumulated value. The simulation output includes a historical baseline (HIST; 1990–2005) and two epochs at the end of the twenty-first century (EOC; 2085–2100) under intermediate and pessimistic emissions scenarios. Independent observations illustrate that HIST admirably represents extreme precipitation climatology for most locations in the domain. Comparisons between HIST and the two EOC scenarios for the 99th percentile of daily precipitation show statistically significant increases during Dec–May across the Midwest and Ohio Valley and statistically significant decreases for the southern Great Plains during Dec–Feb. Extreme value analysis further reveals increasing variability in precipitation extremes for eight climatologically unique cities across the CONUS by the end of the twenty-first century and significant increases in return period precipitation amounts for most cities examined. These results provide additional guidance for stakeholders to reduce societal impacts and economic loss from daily precipitation extremes and create a more climate-resilient society.',\n",

Both longer- and shorter-track tornadoes were associated with vast ranges of mixed-layer convective available potential energy, together with relatively low mixed-layer lifted condensation level heights and minimal convective inhibition. A large range of 500–9000-m wind speeds and bulk wind differences, 500–3000-m streamwise vorticities, storm-relative helicities, and storm-relative wind speeds were found for STTs. In stark contrast, LTTs only occurred when these kinematic attributes were larger in amplitude through the troposphere, supporting previously documented associations between observed longer-track tornado pathlengths and faster-propagating parent storms. A novel parameter, heavily weighted by kinematic parameters and lightly weighted by thermodynamic parameters, outperformed the significant tornado parameter in differentiating environments that were more supportive of both LTTs as well as tornadoes rated &lt;EF5. The high correlation values R 2 = 0.79 between tornado pathlength and Bunkers’ approximate tornado duration (pathlength / V Bunkers ) calls for improved understanding of mesocyclone periodicities, which impact tornado longevity, to improve tornado pathlength diagnoses and forecasts. Pragmatically, diagnosing LTT environments using vertical profile attributes, perhaps, is not so much a problem of determining when there might be higher expectations for LTTs, but rather a problem of when there might be lower expectations for LTTs, e.g., weaker kinematic attributes in the lower troposphere.',\n",
       "   'Abstract This study uses high-resolution, convection-permitting, dynamically downscaled regional climate simulation output to assess how long-lived, convectively induced, extratropical windstorms known as derechos may change across the CONUS during the 21st century. Three 15-year epochs including a historical period (1990 – 2005), and two, separate late-21st century periods (2085 – 2100) employing intermediate (RCP 4.5) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas concentration scenarios are evaluated. A mesoscale convective system (MCS) identification and tracking tool catalogs derecho candidates across epochs using simulated radar reflectivity and maximum 10-meter wind speed as a proxy for near-surface severe wind gusts. Results indicate that MCS-based windstorms, including derechos, are more frequent, widespread, and intense in both future climate scenarios examined for most regions of the central and eastern CONUS. Increases are suggested across all parts of the year, with significant changes in populations concentrated during the early spring and summer months, suggesting the potential for a longer, more extreme MCS windstorm season. This research provides insights for forecasters, emergency managers, and wind-vulnerable stakeholders on how these events may change across the 21 st century so that they may mitigate, adapt to, and become resilient against severe convective storm perils.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Changes in the frequency and intensity of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are assessed using convection-permitting regional climate model simulations. We present a novel classification method that relates MCSs to the magnitude of their large-scale forcing environments to better understand the changing nature of MCSs across different forcing environments in a possible future climate scenario. Overall, the annual frequency, intensity, and amount of precipitation associated with MCSs are projected to increase for broad portions of the eastern conterminous United States (CONUS). Furthermore, changes in the characteristics of MCSs show larger, longer-lived, and faster MCSs particularly over the Midwest and Southeast. Seasonal examination of this response reveals a robust intensification of March–May (MAM) MCSs. The higher frequency of MAM MCSs are found to occur in weakly forced synoptic environments. Increased rainfall amounts are explained by an intensification of MCSs due to changing thermodynamics and enhanced lower-tropospheric moisture transport into the central CONUS by the North Atlantic Subtropical High. Differences in mid-latitude storm tracks are favorable towards the enhanced development of MCSs associated with strong baroclinic forcing within the Midwest and Northern Plains, but are only realized in the presence of strong changes in lower-tropospheric moisture transport. Overall, these results suggest a shift in the behavior of MAM MCSs that more closely corresponds to the behavior of June–August (JJA) MCSs in the historical climate. The increased occurrence of MCSs in weakly forced environments, particularly in MAM, deserves further investigation.',\n",

       "   'Abstract USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service pasture and rangeland condition data were used to establish a novel spatiotemporal climatology of condition ratings across the conterminous United States for the May–October grazing season over the 1995–2022 study period. On average, the coverage of grazing land that provides adequate or excess feed underwent a significant reduction during a typical season. Spatially, the southwestern United States exhibited the poorest grazing land conditions on average, with over 20 years below the national mean condition rating. At the national aggregated level, conditions degraded during the 28‐year study period, and the most significant trends were observed for grazing lands considered to have poor or very poor condition coverage, which increased. Robustly increasing trends in poor and very poor condition coverage were most apparent across the western half of the United States, which is predominantly rangeland. Meanwhile, the eastern half of the United States, which is mostly pastureland, generally experienced condition improvements. Overall, continued regional climatic changes that may result in increasing temperatures, variable precipitation totals, and subsequent soil moisture declines leading to increased drought instances will continue to impose challenges for grazing land managers. Grazing land condition declines can result in increased feed supply demand and reduced grazing capacity. Should these trends continue, there will be a growing need for flexible livestock, forage, and grazing management strategies in the coming decades to adapt to climate change‐induced impacts on water‐sensitive ecosystems.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The presence and biological role of extracellular DNA (eDNA) have been explored in diverse microbial environments. Nonetheless, it has not been studied in the chicken gut microbiome. This study aims to investigate eDNA in the chicken cecum, analyzing cecal samples from broiler chickens using three preparation methods: Whole Cecal Suspension (WCS), Washed Cell Pellets (WCP), and Cell-Free Supernatant (CFS). The 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis revealed distinct microbial communities in CFS compared to WCS and WCP (p = 0.001). Notably, specific taxa, including Anaerofilum, Anaerotruncus, Oscillospira, Syntrophomonas, and Delftia, were enriched in CFS. Confocal fluorescence microscopy, employing stains such as Propidium Iodide (PI), GelGreen, and SYTO 9, confirmed the presence of eDNA with filaments observed in WCS and CFS. Colocalization of PI and GelGreen™ validated the extracellular nature of eDNA, while DNase I treatment selectively degraded eDNA, further confirming its extracellular nature. Our findings in this study highlight the presence of eDNA in the chicken cecal microbiome, and the presence of eDNA associated with specific taxonomic groups suggest that it might play a specific role in the biological function of the cecal microbiome, which warrants further investigation in the future.',\n",
       "   'With the global rise of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial stewardship efforts have been on the rise significantly. Antibiograms have become vital tools in enabling clinical decision making, guiding empirical therapy and mapping epidemiological resistance patterns. The antibiograms have now developed from the traditional antibiogram to the rolling antibiograms that changes with time to the electronic versions of the tool. Additionally, antibiograms are now bridging the gap in precision medicine with personalized antibiograms and machine learning approaches. In this review, we understand from existing literature that although antibiogram is being widely used, adherence to the standard guidelines is relatively lower in rates. Standardising antibiograms by sticking to the CLSI consensus M39 guidelines can be constitutive in making antibiograms more versatile. It has also been identified that many physicians are not used to utilizing antibiograms in their day-to-day practice. As resistance tracking tools, antibiotics can help understand local patterns of resistance in a community that can help public health policies or clinical choices. Enhancing ease of use and continuum education on their utility as part of Antimicrobial Stewardship programmes is fundamental in bridging this gap.',\n",

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of PCOS and its relation with age and over-nutrition among the reproductive age women of India. In order to evaluate the prevalence rate of PCOS, which was correlated to obesity and age, a cross-sectional study was undertaken among 100 reproductive women in India aged 21-40 by utilizing digital platform. The quantitative data shows that prevalence of obesity was 34% among the selected respondents. Among the behavioural risk factors of the PCOS, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, caffeine consumption and sedentary life style shows significant association with prevalence of obesity among the PCOS patients. Furthermore, based on the evidence, it's possible to conclude that there's a link between reproductive age and PCOS, as well as the occurrence of over-nutrition. The data of the study shows a significant association of age with the prevalence of obesity among the PCOS patients.\"],\n",

       "   'This paper investigates the problem of recovering source terms in abstract initial value problems (IVP) commonly used to model various scientific phenomena in physics, chemistry, economics, and other fields. We consider source terms of the form $F=h+\\\\eta$, where $\\\\eta$ is a Lipschitz continuous background source. The primary objective is to estimate the unknown parameters of non-instantaneous sources $h(t)=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{j=0}^M h_je^{-\\\\rho_j(t-t_j)}\\\\chi_{[t_j,\\\\infty)}(t)$, such as the decay rates, initial intensities and activation times. We present two novel recovery algorithms that employ distinct sampling methods of the solution of the IVP. Algorithm 1 combines discrete and weighted average measurements, whereas Algorithm 2 uses a different variant of weighted average measurements. We analyze the performance of these algorithms, providing upper bounds on the recovery errors of the model parameters. Our focus is on the structure of the dynamical samples used by the algorithms and on the error guarantees they yield.',\n",
       "   \"We show that the classical Prony's method for recovery of a sparse signal from its consecutive Fourier coefficients can be viewed as a spectral identification problem for an unknown restriction of a known linear operator.

       "   'We consider similarity transformations of a perturbed linear operator $A-B$ in a complex Banach space $\\\\mathcal{X}$, where the unperturbed operator $A$ is a generator of a Banach $L_1(\\\\mathbb{R})$-module and the perturbation operator $B$ is a bounded linear operator. The result of the transformation is a simpler operator $A-B_0$. For example, if $A$ is a differentiation operator and $B$ is an operator of multiplication by an operator-valued function, then $B_0$ is an operator of multiplication by a function that is a restriction of an entire function of exponential type and could be $0$ in some cases. As a consequence, we derive the spectral invariance of the operator $A-B$ in a large class of spaces. The study is based on a widely applicable modification of the method of similar operators that is also presented in the paper. This non-traditional modification is rooted in the spectral theory of Banach $L_1(\\\\mathbb{R})$-modules.',\n",

       "   'Among the emerging contaminants, microplastics (1-5,000 µm) are becoming an important issue due to their ubiquity in the environment. However, research on this emerging contaminant has been conducted mainly in marine surface waters while microplastics (MPs) are now being found in even the most remote parts of the environment. For example, in groundwater which is the primary water source which supply the world, scientists are just starting to gather evidence on risks to groundwater and dependent ecosystems. This paper reviews the current understanding of plastic contamination in groundwater, summarizes methods that can be used for sampling and detection of plastics as well as the status of environmental regulation of plastics. From the handful of published studies, MPs origins in groundwater are mainly from wastewater effluent, road runoff, agricultural activities, and landfill leachate. The relevant nature of these contaminants are related to their high specific surface area and hydrophobicity allowing co-contamination with various hazardous chemicals such as PCBs, PAHs, BPA, PBDEs, heavy metals and antibiotics. Related to this issues of co-contamination in groundwater, there are potential risks to human health and wider ecosystems that are poorly understood and there has been almost no research undertaken on the occurrence of nanoplastics (&amp;lt;1 \\uf06dm) in groundwater systems. MPs can potentially contribute to cardiovascular diseases, skin irritation, cancer, reproductive effects, and respiratory and digestive problems. In addition, soil and groundwater contamination can be detrimental to aquatic micro-organisms. There is an urgent need to develop a better understanding of the risks MP and associated co-contaminants pose and advance national and regional regulations to restrict microplastic contamination of groundwater.',\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction.

       "   'The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider took data from 2019 to 2022 (Run 1) and is currently undergoing its planned first long shutdown (LS1). During its operational period, SuperKEKB achieved a record-breaking instantaneous luminosity of 4.7 x 10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ [1] and Belle II recorded a dataset corresponding to 428 fb$^{-1}$. The Belle II Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD), which is the innermost sub-detector, is based on the DEpleted P-channel Field Effect Transistor (DEPFET) technology [2]. Along with the Silicon Vertex Detector (SVD) [3], utilizing double-sided silicon strips, this forms the Belle II Vertex Detector system (VXD), enabling precise reconstruction of primary and decay vertices. The PXD module features a 75 $\\\\mu$m-thin DEPFET sensor area with varying pixel sizes from 50 x 55 $\\\\mu$m to 50 x 85 $\\\\mu$m while maintaining a hit efficiency of about 99 %. Its average material budget inside the physics acceptance corresponds to 0.2 % X$_{0}$ per layer. PXD consist of 20 ladders arranged in two cylindrical layers around the beam axis. The Run 1 PXD was installed in a reduced configuration comprising the full inner layer (L1, eight ladders) and only two out of twelve outer layer (L2) ladders. In this article, we will illuminate the performance and operational challenges observed during its 4-year operation in a harsh environment characterized by a high beam background level. A fully populated detector can compensate acceptance losses by redundancy and reduce the probability of wrong hit assignment introduced by higher background levels resulting from increased instantaneous luminosity. During LS1 PXD was replaced by a new, fully populated PXD2. Its commissioning and testing phase during LS1 will be described. A hit efficiency of $>$98 % was measured in most regions using cosmic particles. The current installation schedule foresees beam operation to resume in winter 23/24.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Discovering causal influences among internal variables is a fundamental goal of complex systems research. This paper presents a framework for uncovering hidden relationships from limited time-series data by combining methods from nonlinear estimation and information theory. The approach is based on two sequential steps: first, we reconstruct a more complete state of the underlying dynamical system, and second, we calculate mutual information between pairs of internal state variables to detail causal dependencies. Equipped with time-series data related to the spread of COVID-19 from the past three years, we apply this approach to identify the drivers of falling and rising infections during the three main waves of infection in the Chicago metropolitan region. The unscented Kalman filter nonlinear estimation algorithm is implemented on an established epidemiological model of COVID-19, which we refine to include isolation, masking, loss of immunity, and stochastic transition rates. Through the systematic study of mutual information between infection rate and various stochastic parameters, we find that increased mobility, decreased mask use, and loss of immunity post sickness played a key role in rising infections, while falling infections were controlled by masking and isolation.',\n",
       "   'Robotic search often involves teleoperating vehicles into unknown environments. In such scenarios, prior knowledge of target location or environmental map may be a viable resource to tap into and control other autonomous robots in the vicinity towards an improved search performance. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that despite having the same skill, prior knowledge of target or environment affects teleoperator actions, and such knowledge can therefore be inferred through robot movement. To investigate whether prior knowledge can improve human-robot team performance, we next evaluate an adaptive mutual-information blending strategy that admits a time-dependent weighting for steering autonomous robots. Human-subject experiments show that several features including distance travelled by the teleoperated robot, time spent staying still, speed, and turn rate, all depend on the level of prior knowledge and that absence of prior knowledge increased workload. Building on these results, we identified distance travelled and time spent staying still as movement cues that can be used to robustly infer prior knowledge. Simulations where an autonomous robot accompanied a human teleoperated robot revealed that whereas time to find the target was similar across all information-based search strategies, adaptive strategies that acted on movement cues found the target sooner more often than a single human teleoperator compared to non-adaptive strategies. This gain is diluted with number of robots, likely due to the limited size of the search environment. Results from this work set the stage for developing knowledge-aware control algorithms for autonomous robots in collaborative human-robot teams.'],\n",

Abstract:Background: Dioscorea polystachya (DP) starch, a low-cost, abundant, renewable and degradable starch, is being explored as a potential pharmaceutical excipient for drug formulation. Objectives: This study aimed to explore and isolate starch from Dioscorea polystachya and evaluate the excipients' properties.Materials and Methods: To study the phytochemical, physicochemical, morphological, rheological and emulsifying properties.Results: The isolated matter yields 40.5% starch from its dry weight of tubers and contains carbohydrates, moisture, lipids, nitrogen and various minerals. DP starch has 22.58±0.22% amylose and exhibits a non-Newtonian flow behaviour. The emulsifying capacity improved with the increasing starch concentration and provided significant emulsion stability through different oil ratios to polysaccharide solution. It showed an excellent foaming ability; however, foam stability gradually reduced over time .Conclusion: These findings indicate that Dioscorea polystachya starch provides significant excipient properties so that it could be used as an excipient in the pharmaceutical industry.

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"ABSTRACT Career resilience is critical to the world's aging workforce, aiding older workers in adapting to the ever‐evolving nature of work. While ageist stereotypes often depict older workers as less resilient when faced with workplace changes, existing research studies offer conflicting evidence on whether older age hinders or improves career resilience. In response to this conflicting evidence, the present study employs multi‐level data from 6772 employees in 28 countries to examine the age‐career resilience relationships and underlying mechanisms, hence advancing our understanding of career resilience across the life course. By integrating macro‐contextual factors such as the unemployment rate and the culture of education with individual‐level mechanisms such as positive career meaning and career optimism, we provide a comprehensive model explaining how career resilience varies across age groups. Grounded in life course theory, our findings resolve prior inconsistencies in resilience research, contribute to bridging the micro‐macro gap in HRM literature, and challenge existing age‐based stereotypes.\",\n",

However, this literature is fragmented with scholars disagreeing on the conceptualization and measurement of AM, as well as a lack of consensus on the dimensions of AM influencing various gig worker‐related outcomes, the mechanisms through which these influences are exerted, and the relevant boundary conditions. To address these issues, we systematically reviewed the academic literature across scientific disciplines related to the AM of gig workers using natural language processing (NLP)‐based topic modeling. Our analysis yielded 12 topics, which we integrate using an input‐process‐output (IPO) framework to illustrate differing effects of AM on worker‐related outcomes. Based on our findings, we provide a comprehensive definition of AM, including its key dimensions, and highlight main mediating pathways through which the individual dimensions of AM impact various gig worker‐related outcomes. Finally, we provide a roadmap for future research on AM in the gig economy (GE) using an organizational behavior lens.',\n",
       "   'Abstract The confluence of changing employment norms and technological innovations is bringing forth a work ecosystem characterized by increases in episodic work, virtuality, individualization of labour, and transformation of jobs. Our paper builds upon existing scholarship, and data on labour trends to propose a framework that views the interactions between key entities (workers, customers, organizations, and platforms) and institutions as continuously shaping the nature of work. Viewing micro‐ecosystems, such as gig work performed using technology platforms and traditional employment ecosystems, as subsets of this emergent work ecosystem, we generate specific propositions to guide human resource management (HRM) research and explore the implications of the emerging work ecosystem for HRM practice.',\n",

       "   \"Abstract Understanding how administrators can commit unethical acts is an important goal of public administration research. This article tests whether moral inversion, taken from Balfour, Adams, and Nickels' theory of administrative evil, can help explain torture, and also proposes and tests Bandura's theory of moral disengagement. It analyzes testimony from perpetrators of torture who testified before the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996–2000. The results support moral inversion, as perpetrators stated that they believed their actions were morally justified. The results also support displacement of responsibility, as perpetrators shifted responsibility away from themselves and toward actors above or below them in the chain of command. However, the analysis does not support the theory of diffusion of responsibility, as perpetrators did not take the silence of officials outside of their chain of command as approval, but instead anticipated their disapproval and tried to conceal their actions.\"],\n",

However, these materials typically suffer from poor capacity, unstable cycling performance, and sluggish Na + kinetics. Herein, we explore a manganese‐based layered transition metal oxide (Na x N 0.25 Mn 0.75 O 2 ) and show by X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and high‐angle annular dark‐field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF‐STEM) that careful variation of the sodium content can instigate the formation of a biphasic intergrowth. This intergrown P2/P3 material offered a higher capacity than its monophasic P2 counterpart due to the P3 structure having greater low‐voltage Mn 3+/4+ redox. Further, the intergrowth material offers greatly enhanced kinetics and cycling stability when compared to single‐phase P3 material, due to the stabilizing nature of the P2 structure, elucidated by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and operando synchrotron X‐ray diffraction. These results highlight the beneficial effect that the intergrowth structure has on the electrochemical performance of high‐manganese content positive electrode for future sodium‐ion batteries.',\n",

       "   '<title>Abstract</title> Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution in acidic media at industrial-level current densities is limited by high overpotential, performance degradation, and thus low throughput. To address these issues, we developed a novel nanoedge-enriched molybdenum oxycarbide (MoO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>C<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>) electrocatalysts with a uniform phase by non-equilibrium plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The vertically standing MoO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>C<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> exhibits low overpotential of 415 mV and outstanding long-term operational stability (~ 0.11% performance degradation over 1,000 h) at high current densities up to 10 A cm<sup>− 2</sup>, corresponding to an ultrahigh hydrogen throughput of 4,477.4 L cm<sup>− 2</sup> and a lifetime throughput of 407,033 L cm<sup>− 2</sup> which exceed the department of energy (DOE) targets of 1,253.7 L cm<sup>− 2</sup> and 100,503 L cm<sup>− 2</sup>, respectively. Molybdenum oxycarbide catalysts outperform state-of-the-art transition metal- and even noble metal-based catalysts (throughput of 9 ~ 269 L cm<sup>− 2</sup> and lifetime throughput of 8 ~ 269 L cm<sup>− 2</sup>) by more than an order of magnitude for throughput and three orders of magnitude for lifetime throughput. The key mechanisms enabling high catalytic performance and stability are achieved by incorporating carbon into MoO<sub>2</sub> lattices, which reduces the valence state of Mo, leading to weakened binding energy of Mo-H and thus improved hydrogen evolution performance. Density functional theory results suggest that the presence of carbon atoms in MoO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>C<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> increases the binding energy between Mo and the adjacent atoms, improving the stability of MoO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>C<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> operating under harsh conditions.

       "   'P2-type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (PNNMO) has been extensively studied because of its desirable electrochemical properties as a positive electrode for sodium-ion batteries. PNNMO exhibits intralayer transition-metal ordering of Ni and Mn and intralayer Na+/vacancy ordering. The Na+/vacancy ordering is often considered a major impediment to fast Na+ transport and can be affected by transition-metal ordering. We show by neutron/X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations that Li doping (Na2/3Li0.05Ni1/3Mn2/3O2, LFN5) promotes ABC-type interplanar Ni/Mn ordering without disrupting the Na+/vacancy ordering and creates low-energy Li–Mn-coordinated diffusion pathways. A structure model is developed to quantitatively identify both the intralayer cation mixing and interlayer cationic stacking fault densities. Quasielastic neutron scattering reveals that the Na+ diffusivity in LFN5 is enhanced by an order of magnitude over PNNMO, increasing its capacity at a high current. Na2/3Ni1/4Mn3/4O2 (NM13) lacks Na+/vacancy ordering but has diffusivity comparable to that of LFN5. However, NM13 has the smallest capacity at a high current. The high site energy of Mn–Mn-coordinated Na compared to that of Ni–Mn and higher density of Mn–Mn-coordinated Na+ sites in NM13 disrupts the connectivity of low-energy Ni–Mn-coordinated diffusion pathways. These results suggest that the interlayer ordering can be tuned through the control of composition, which has an equal or greater impact on Na+ diffusion than the Na+/vacancy ordering.',\n",
       "   'Ether solvents are suitable for formulating solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)-less ion-solvent cointercalation electrolytes in graphite for Na-ion and K-ion batteries. However, ether-based electrolytes have been historically perceived to cause exfoliation of graphite and cell failure in Li-ion batteries. In this study, we develop strategies to achieve reversible Li-solvent cointercalation in graphite through combining appropriate Li salts and ether solvents. Specifically, we design 1M LiBF4 1,2-dimethoxyethane (G1), which enables natural graphite to deliver ~91% initial Coulombic efficiency and >88% capacity retention after 400 cycles. We captured the spatial distribution of LiF at various length scales and quantified its heterogeneity. The electrolyte shows self-terminated reactivity on graphite edge planes and results in a grainy, fluorinated pseudo-SEI. The molecular origin of the pseudo-SEI is elucidated by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The operando synchrotron analyses further demonstrate the reversible and monotonous phase transformation of cointercalated graphite. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of Li cointercalation chemistry in graphite for extreme-condition batteries. The work also paves the foundation for understanding and modulating the interphase generated by ether electrolytes in a broad range of electrodes and batteries.',\n",

In this study, Li + transport in structurally modified Li 3 HoCl 6 , via Br − introduction and Li + deficiency, is explored. The optimized Li 3‐3 y Ho 1+ y Cl 6‐ x Br x achieves an ionic conductivity of 3.8 mS cm −1 at 25 °C, the highest reported for holmium halide materials. 6,7 Li nuclear magnetic resonance and relaxometry investigations unveil enhanced ion dynamics with bromination, attaining a Li + motional rate neighboring 116 MHz. X‐ray diffraction analyses reveal mixed‐anion‐induced phase transitions with disproportionate octahedral expansions and distortions, creating Ho‐free planes with favorable energetics for Li + migration. Bond valence site energy analysis highlights preferred Li + transport pathways, particularly in structural planes devoid of Ho 3+ blocking effects. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate enhanced Li + diffusion with Br − introduction into Li 3 HoCl 6 . Li‐Ho electrostatic repulsions in the (001) plane presumably drive Li + diffusion into the Ho‐free (002) layer, enabling rapid intraplanar Li + motion and exchange between the 2d and 4h sites. Li 3‐3 y Ho 1+ y Cl 6‐ x Br x also demonstrates good battery cycling stability.

       "   'Abstract Co‐free Li‐rich layered oxides (CFLLOs) with anionic redox activity are among the most promising cathode materials for high‐energy‐density and low‐cost lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). However, irreversible oxygen release often causes severe structural deterioration, electrolyte decomposition, and the formation of unstable cathode‐electrolyte interface (CEI) film with high impedance. Additionally, the elimination of cobalt elements further deteriorates the reaction kinetics, leading to reduced capacity and poor rate performance. Here, a multifunctional strategy is proposed, incorporating Li 2 MnO 3 phase content regulation, micro‐nano structure design, and heteroatom substitution. The increased content of Li 2 MnO 3 phase enhances the capacity through oxygen redox. The smaller nanoscale primary particles induce greater tensile strain and introduce more grain boundaries, thereby improving the reaction kinetics and reactivity, while the larger micron‐sized secondary particles help to reduce interfacial side reactions. Furthermore, Na⁺ doping modulates the local coordination environment of oxygen, stabilizing both the anion framework and the crystal structure. As a result, the designed cathode exhibits enhanced rate performance, delivering a capacity of 158 mAh g⁻¹ at 5.0 C and improved cyclic stability, with a high capacity retention of 99% after 400 cycles at 1.0 C. This multifunctional strategy holds great promise for advancing the practical application of CFLLOs in next‐generation LIBs.',\n",

       "   'The demands for sustainable energy systems underscores the importance in developing sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) with earth abundant raw materials, enhanced energy density, prolonged lifespan, and reduced cost. Among potential candidates for such advancements, intercalation-type layered transition metal oxide (LTMO) positive electrode materials are attractive due to their notable high theoretical specific capacity and tunable chemistry. However, LTMO electrodes are often subjected to anisotropic changes during cycling. Repeated anisotropic changes cause host structure strain, eventually leading to material degradation. Regulating the electrostatic interactions is generally perceived to be a viable approach for structure stabilization in layered oxides during cycling, but conventional synthesis approaches have been unable to tame the effect. Here, we demonstrate negligible anisotropic changes in layered P2-type Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 2 through regulation of electrostatic repulsion realized by modulation of transition metal ions occupancy. The electrode exhibits a capacity retention of 83.3% in 100 cycles between 2 - 4.3 V, which is significantly better than the 36.9% retention of the pristine sample. Our study emphasizes the highly correlated nature of the redox mechanism that deserves the attention and is critical for high-energy batteries.',\n",
       "   'P2-typeNa 2/3 Ni 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 (PNNMO) has been extensively studied because of itsdesirable electrochemical properties as a positive electrode for sodium ion batteries. PNNMO exhibits intralayer transition metal ordering of Ni and Mn and intralayer Na + /vacancy ordering. The Na + /vacancy ordering is often considered a major impediment to fast Na + transport and can be affected by the transition metal ordering. We show by neutron/X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations that Li doping (Na 2/3 Li 0.05 Ni 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 , LFN5) promotes ABC-type interplanar Ni/Mn ordering without disrupting the Na + /vacancy ordering and creates low-energy Li-Mn coordinated diffusion pathways. A structure model is developed to quantitatively identify both the intralayer cation mixing and interlayer cationic stacking fault densities. Quasielastic neutron scattering reveals that the Na + diffusivity in LFN5 is enhanced by an order of magnitude over PNNMO, increasing its capacity at high current. Na 2/3 Ni 1/4 Mn 3/4 O 2 (NM13) lacks Na + /vacancy ordering but has comparable diffusivity to LFN5. However, NM13 has the smallest capacity at a high current. The high site energy of Mn-Mn coordinated Na compared to Ni-Mn, and higher density of Mn-Mn coordinated Na + sites in NM13 disrupts the connectivity of low-energy Ni-Mn coordinated diffusion pathways. These results suggest that the interlayer ordering can be tuned through the control of composition, which has an equal or greater impact on Na+ diffusion than the Na+/ vacancy ordering.',\n",
       "   'Recent advancements have highlighted the P2-layered Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 2 (NNMO) cathode material as a leading candidate for next-generation sodium-ion batteries due to its superior specific capacity. Traditional solid-state synthesis methods, while straightforward and scalable, struggle with challenges such as achieving homogeneous atomic-level elemental distribution and mitigating the formation of intermediate phases during powder mixing. In contrast, the molten salt synthesis method offers a controllable and efficient alternative for producing uniform materials with varied chemical compositions and structures. In this study, we utilize sodium chloride as the molten salt flux, with Na 2 CO 3 , NiO, and Mn 2 O 3 as reactants, to synthesize single-crystal MS-NNMO. This method yields an NNMO with an initial reversible capacity of 90.6 mAh g −1 at 0.1C across a voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V, demonstrating 88.5% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Long-term stability is further evidenced by an 83.9% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1C. In full cell tests, MS-NNMO paired with a hard carbon anode shows 90.3% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C. Additionally, MS-NNMO exhibits exceptional bulk stability, with no impurity peaks detected after 1 hour of water exposure, underscoring its superior air stability. This work validates the molten salt method as an effective and scalable process for producing high-performance sodium-ion battery cathodes.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) impacts 50% of U.S. adults although few studies evaluate young adults’ cardiovascular disease risk. Early identification of cardiovascular disease risk may mitigate increased adulthood incidence. We analyzed (CVD) risk factors and their association with cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text] o 2 max) to devise effective strategies to improve cardiovascular health across the lifespan. Methods A cross-sectional study evaluated the effect of a single bout of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular disease risk factors in adults aged 18 to 36 years. Glycemic control (HbA 1C ), cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text]o 2 max), percent body fat, lean body mass, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. Results Statistically significant relationships were observed between percent body fat (r = .83, P &lt; .001) and BMI, and waist circumference (r = .83, P &lt; .001) and BMI. Percent body fat ( P &lt; .001) and race ( P = .018) predicted exercise time, with Asians exercising the longest. Percent fat ( P &lt; .001) and HbA 1C ( P = .039) were identified as predictors of cardiovascular fitness which was low in spite of primarily normal average HbA 1C levels. Conclusions HbA 1C and body fat negatively influence cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text] o 2 max) in young adults increasing adulthood cardiovascular disease risk. Research investigating the effect of HbA 1C on cardiovascular health especially in youth is warranted.',\n",
       "   'Introduction: Anxiety and depression are amongst the most common forms of mental illness, of whom 20-30% experience concomitant cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) improves brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) potentially improving mental health and resilience. Unique barriers to increasing PA engagement exist in those with mental distress, contributing to CVD risk. Research strategies using guideline-based PA programming and motivation may enhance mental well-being, thereby mitigating CVD risk. Objective: To examine the effects of meeting weekly PA recommendations on levels of depression, anxiety, resilience, and associations with CVD risk factors in sedentary middle-aged adults. Methods: Sedentary adults (n=29, 40-60 years) completed a tailored 4-week MVPA regimen after establishing baseline CRF (VO 2 max) using an Astrand-Rhyming cycle ergometer test. Activity trackers (Mi Smart Band 6; Xiaomi) recorded heart rate (HR), and daily steps, along with motivational messaging. Mental health status was measured by pre- and post - brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and depression (BDI-II), and anxiety (BAI) scores. CVD risk factors included resting HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), HbA1c, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, and lean body mass. Logistical regression determined if factors related to mental health affected achieving MVPA goal. Nonparametric analysis compared pre- and post-response to MVPA. Results: Percentage change of meeting the PA goal decreased by 29% (p=0.048) when the depression score increased by one point. When anxiety scores increased by one point, the likelihood of meeting PA goals increased by 41% (p=0.057). As the resilience score increased by one point, the percentage change of meeting PA goals increased by 17% (p=0.58). Of 29 participants, 19 (65.5%) exhibited no change depression level, two (6.9%) exhibited increased depression, and eight (27.6%) exhibited a decrease in depression. The BDNF decreased in those meeting PA goals, although platelets harbor significant BDNF content posing a profound confounding variable in measured plasma. Following MVPA average weight, BMI and fat mass decreased by 0.5 pounds, 0.11 kg/m 2 and 0.42 lbs., respectively. HbA1c decreased by 0.05% nearing significance (p=0.056). Significant improvements were observed in SBP by 5.44 mmHg (p=0.026) and resting HR (p=0.001). On average WC, fat free mass and VO 2 max increased by 0.61 cm, 9.44 kg/m 2 and 1.22 ml/kg/min respectively. Conclusions: MVPA consistent with the guidelines in middle-aged adults predicts improved anxiety and depression compared to sedentary behavior, likely improving cardiovascular health. A longer-term study to evaluate body composition and metabolic response to PA, in addition to further investigation of BDNF to assess its value in response to MVPA is currently warranted.',\n",
       "   'Among the twenty proteinogenic amino acids, glutamine and asparagine represent a unique cohort in containing a terminal amide in their side chain, and share a direct metabolic relationship, with glutamine generating asparagine through the ATP-dependent asparagine synthetase (ASNS) reaction. Circulating glutamine levels and metabolic flux through cells and tissues greatly exceed those for asparagine, and \"glutamine addiction\" in cancer has likewise received considerable attention. However, historic and recent evidence collectively suggest that in spite of its modest presence, asparagine plays an outsized regulatory role in cellular function. Here, we present a unifying evidence-based hypothesis that the amides constitute a regulatory signaling circuit, with glutamine as a driver and asparagine as a second messenger that allosterically regulates key biochemical and physiological functions, particularly cell growth and survival. Specifically, it is proposed that ASNS serves as a sensor of substrate sufficiency for S-phase entry and progression in proliferating cells. ASNS-generated asparagine serves as a subsequent second messenger that modulates the activity of key regulatory proteins and promotes survival in the face of cellular stress, and serves as a feed-forward driver of S-phase progression in cell growth. We propose that this signaling pathway be termed the Amide Signaling Circuit (ASC) in homage to the SLC1A5-encoded ASCT2 that transports both glutamine and asparagine in a bidirectional manner, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of human cancers. Support for the ASC model is provided by the recent discovery that glutamine is sensed in primary cilia via ASNS during metabolic stress.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['About 53 million adults in the United States offer informal care to family and friends with disease or disability. Such care has an estimated economic value of US $600 million. Most informal caregivers are not paid nor trained in caregiving, with many experiencing higher-than-average levels of stress and depression and lower levels of physical health. Some informal caregivers participate in web-based forums related to their caregiving role. This study aimed to explore how informal caregivers use easy-to-access caregiving web-based forums, including the types of information they share and seek from others. It also aimed to gain insights into the informal caregiver experience from the content these informal caregivers posted. The study population consisted of participants who posted on 5 web-based forums for informal caregivers between February and April 2024. Researchers extracted the first 6 responses to the first 20 questions and comments to appear posted by the informal caregivers in each of the 5 forums, removing any individually identifying information. We used a codebook thematic analysis approach to examine the data with Dedoose (SocioCultural Research Consultants). Researchers independently read all posts and coded the data. The author group discussed the codes, reiteratively refined them, and identified themes within the data. The data consisted of 100 initial posts and 600 responses. Over half of the initial posts included specific questions, with the remaining initial posts sharing experiences or reflections. Posts ranged in length from a sentence to more than 500 words. Domains identified included handling interpersonal challenges, navigating complicated systems, gathering tactical coping strategies, managing emotions, and connecting with others in similar situations. Negative interpersonal interactions were mentioned 123 times, with 77 posts describing challenging situations with extended family. Posters inquired about accessing resources, with health care and health insurance included 51 times, while legal and financial concerns were addressed 124 times. Caregiving challenges were mentioned hundreds of times, including discussion of hygiene (n=18), nutrition (n=21), and desire for a caregiving break (n=47). Posters expressed emotion in their comments 180 times, which included 32 mentions of guilt and 26 mentions of positive emotion. The importance of web-based group support was mentioned 301 times. Informal caregivers play an essential role in society. Many experience multifaceted challenges related to their caregiving role, and some turn to the internet for community. Accessing web-based discussion forums is a low-barrier method for informal caregivers to connect with others who may be experiencing similar emotions and challenges. Gaining a greater understanding of the ways informal caregivers seek advice and offer support to one another provides insight into the challenges they face. The domains identified on these forums may be helpful, as clinicians provide information to care recipients and their informal caregivers along their health journeys.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Objectives Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer. Family caregivers of individuals with GBM must navigate a wide range of their care recipients’ physical, cognitive, and psychosocial deficits to provide effective care, which is both mentally and physically demanding. This study aimed to investigate the perspectives of family caregivers of GBM patients about the barriers and challenges they encounter when providing care to their care recipients. Methods Nineteen current and former family caregivers for individuals with GBM participated in semi-structured interviews from October 2023 through January 2024. We conducted interviews virtually and used applied thematic analysis to code transcripts to determine themes among participant responses. Results Three themes emerged from the interview analysis: (1) overwhelming caregiver burden, (2) difficulties coping with the caregiver role, and (3) gaps in caregiver support. These themes demonstrated a significant physical and mental toll on caregivers and a lack of time for engaging in coping strategies. The family caregivers described a lack of resources, minimal education, and limited time with their medical providers left them feeling ill-prepared for their role. Most family caregivers indicated their care recipients did not use rehabilitation services and the family caregivers expressed confusion about hospice and palliative care. Significance of results Family caregivers for individuals with GBM desire more straightforward and proactive information and education about their care recipients from their medical providers. There is an opportunity for more utilization of hospice, palliative, and rehabilitation services to provide necessary training to GBM patients and their caregivers.',\n",
       "   \"A breast cancer diagnosis can impact every aspect of a woman's life, particularly for women diagnosed before age 45 when they are in the process of establishing stability in their personal and professional lives. This study investigated the impact of a breast cancer diagnosis on employment, finances, and personal relationships among young breast cancer survivors. We conducted descriptive statistical analysis of survey data from 315 women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45. Surveys were administered electronically and included 40 questions on demographics asking about employment, insurance, income, and marital status at two time points: at diagnosis and at the time the survey was completed. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted. The McNemar-Bowker Test of Symmetry was used to calculate the significance of changes in employment, insurance, income, and marital status at the two time points. We found significant changes following diagnosis in employment and insurance. Prior to diagnosis, 68.6% of respondents were employed full time, compared to 52.4% following diagnosis – falling from 212 to 162 respondents. Individuals who were unable to work increased by 14.6% after diagnosis, rising from 4 to 49 respondents. The decline in full-time employment was highest among those with a diagnosis of Stage IV cancer (33.9%), with the number of full-time worker respondents falling from 79 to 41. We found a significant change in insurance (p < .001) with a decline in individuals with private or no insurance of 4.7% and 3.4%, respectively, while those with public insurance increased by 8.1%. Our findings suggest that young breast cancer survivors are particularly vulnerable to changes in employment, with more than a tenfold increase in the number of young women who reported being unable to work following diagnosis. Our findings also indicate a significant shift from private to public insurance, particularly for individuals living with Stage IV cancer. These results point to opportunities to address the specific needs of young women diagnosed with breast cancer and improve their overall quality of life.\",\n",

Using the 2020 National Health and Aging Trends Study COVID-19 supplement, our sample included 2026 family caregivers of older adults. Structural equation modeling was conducted. Caregivers with financial strains showed worse mental health than those with no financial strains. Female or adult children caregivers reported significantly less time walking, more financial strain, and a higher level of negative mental health outcomes compared to male or spouse caregivers; non-white caregivers reported greater positive mental health outcomes compared to white caregivers during and after the pandemic. Health professionals should consider the financial and mental health impact of COVID-19 among family caregivers when designing and delivering caregiver support programs. This study provides nationally representative estimates of several important health behaviors and health outcomes for caregivers of older adults during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, helping to fill the knowledge gap about the characteristics of caregivers whose health and well-being were most affected by the pandemic.',\n",

This review explores the challenges of the transition from caregiving to widowhood and different coping strategies used by widowed spousal caregivers. A systematic review of literature on the transition from caregiving to widowhood was conducted using four major academic search engines. Overall, 280 articles were identified, with 22 meeting the inclusion criteria. Challenges for widowed caregivers included experiencing care burden, letting go of the caregiver role, grief, and triggers. Widowed caregivers' coping strategies included social support and services use, filling the time gap, finding spirituality, and engaging in unhealthy behaviors. Future research is needed to determine the efficacy of widowed caregivers' coping strategies. Concerted and collaborative action by health professionals, community organizations, and policymakers is needed to develop programs and other approaches to support widowed caregivers.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract In the United States, there are nearly 53 million informal or unpaid caregivers, many of whom experience mental and physical stress related to their caregiving duties and increased financial responsibility. We identified federal and state informal caregiver support policies authorized by specific legislation along with their key provisions and conducted a systematic review of the academic literature related to quantitative evaluations of these policies. Twenty policies, eight academic studies, and four gray literature reports were included in the study, with half of the policies introduced since 2000. Our study criteria yielded few academic valuations tied to caregiver policies and few policies including research provisions. Of the provision areas identified in policies, respite services, caregiver training, and workplace protections appeared the most. Future policies and the studies examining them should incorporate cost outcomes and equity as focus areas and disaggregate data by vulnerable groups to ensure value and equity in caregiver support legislation. Key messages Increased legislation to support informal caregivers may be warranted. The limited academic research examining existing caregiver policies identifies mixed outcomes for caregivers. Prioritizing vulnerable populations in such policy research examining outcomes could help improve caregiver support efforts. The included studies investigated the outcomes of three policies and identified more negative than positive outcomes for caregivers.',\n",
       "   'Objectives The incidence of hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) is a serious public health issue with implications ranging from patient morbidity and mortality to negative financial impacts on patients and health care systems. Despite substantial efforts to address and reduce HACs, research into the effect of quality improvement programs is inconclusive. This study seeks to better understand the relationship between repeated reimbursement penalties and improvement in HAC quality scores. Methods A quantitative comparative analysis of U.S. health care data was conducted. Data on quality outcomes and hospital characteristics were sourced from the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program from fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Inpatient Prospective Payment System impact files, respectively. Results In total, 3123 U.S. hospitals were analyzed to compare differences between total HAC scores of hospitals with and without penalties in consecutive years. Hospitals with repeated penalties had significantly greater improvement in scores ( t 497.262 = −13.00, P &lt; 0.001), and the impact was greatest in small hospitals (&lt;100 beds). Repeated penalties had a smaller impact on disproportionate share hospitals (Cohen d = 0.73). Among all hospitals, the effect of repeated penalties was large (Cohen d = 0.75) Conclusions This study suggests that repeated penalties can improve quality scores in U.S. hospitals. However, the effect may be exaggerated for smaller hospitals and those that serve patient populations with a relatively higher socioeconomic status. The reason disproportionate share hospitals did not show as much improvement as nondisproportionate hospitals may be because hospitals serving vulnerable populations often have fewer resources.',\n",
       "   'Few studies have examined the association between green space and life expectancy, and only one study has looked at that data for small areas in the United States. These studies have found a positive association between green space and life expectancy. This study investigates the association between green space and small-area life expectancy in Chicago, a city in the United States with distinct environmental and socioeconomic characteristics and the largest U.S. life expectancy gap between neighborhoods. We conducted a spatial analysis using the green space metrics of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), park access, and tree canopy. Additionally, we included 18 lifestyle, environmental, and social covariates. Diagnostic analytics included multiple linear regression, Moran I test for spatial dependence, and principal component analysis with CAR Gaussian model. We performed a simulation to predict life expectancy gain if NDVI was brought to median levels. Our study revealed that after adjusting for covariates and spatial dependence (Moran I test p = 0.012) with a CAR Gaussian model, NDVI (credible interval = 0.292-0.894) demonstrated significance at a 5 % level, while tree canopy (credible interval = -0.404-0.109) and park access (credible interval = -0.258-0.161) did not. Excluding non-significant variables (tree canopy and park access) from the CAR Gaussian model, the median effect of NDVI on life expectancy was 0.491 (95 % credible interval: 0.24–0.718). Projecting this effect to tracts below the median NDVI predicted a gain of 476,000 years of life expectancy for Chicago residents. This study provides evidence that green space and LE are positively correlated, suggesting the potential to increase green space to address current LE gaps. Future research should investigate the mechanisms by which green space correlates to lifespan.',\n",

It addresses the challenge of studying Roman freed persons on the basis of highly fragmentary sources whose contents have been fundamentally shaped by the forces of domination. Even though freed persons were defined through a common legal status and shared the experience of enslavement and manumission, many different interactions could derive from these commonalities in different periods and localities across the empire. Drawing on literary, epigraphic, and archaeological evidence, this book provides cases studies that test the various ways in which juridical categories and normative discourses shaped the social and cultural landscape in which freed people lived. By approaching the literary and epigraphic representations of freed persons in new ways, it nuances the impact of power asymmetries and social strategies on the cultural practices and lived experiences of freed persons.',\n",

       "   'Silver carp is a critically significant species in freshwater aquaculture in China, characterized by its limited tolerance to hypoxia. In this study, a significant SNP locus at Chr8: 29647765 (T/C) associated with hypoxia tolerance traits was identified in Changfeng silver carp, and the homozygotic CC genotype exhibited higher hypoxic tolerance than the homozygotic TT and heterozygotic TC genotypes. Under hypoxic conditions, the hemoglobin concentration increased, with the CC genotype demonstrating a significantly higher level compared with the TT genotype; the activities of antioxidant enzymes including catalase and superoxide dismutase were significantly higher in the CC genotype than in the other genotypes; the area of the gill lamellae was significantly smaller in the CC genotype than in the TT and TC genotypes; and the number of apoptotic cells in the brain was significantly lower in the CC genotype than in the TT and TC genotypes. Sequence analysis showed that this SNP was located in the promoter region of the cathepsin C (CTSC) gene. The expression levels of the CTSC gene were analyzed across the three genotypes, revealing that the CC genotype exhibited significantly lower expression compared with the TT and TC genotypes under hypoxia. This finding suggests that the SNP associated with the CC genotype leads to reduced CTSC expression, which may facilitate better physiological adaptation to hypoxia. Analysis of the promoter region of CTSC found a unique predicted hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) binding site (CGTG) in the T genotype, implying that the differential expression of CTSC among the three genotypes under hypoxic stress may be regulated by HIF-1α, a transcription factor integral to hypoxia adaptation, thereby affecting hypoxia tolerance, which further affects the immune response of the Changfeng silver carp in response to the hypoxic environment. Although SNPs represent significant genetic determinants, their phenotypic effects are predominantly mediated through complex interactions within gene regulatory networks and environmental influences. This study identified an effective SNP site in Changfeng silver carp, providing valuable guidance for future selective breeding and the development of new hypoxia-tolerant varieties.',\n",
       "   \"In animals, a trade-off exists between reproduction and growth, which are the most fundamental traits. Males and females exhibit profound differences in reproduction and growth in fish species. However, the precise molecular mechanism governing this phenomenon is still not clear. Here, we uncovered that chr23-miR-200s and dmrt1 knockout specifically caused an impairment in reproduction and an increase in body growth in female and male zebrafish, respectively. Chr23-miR-200s and Dmrt1 directly regulate the stat5b gene by targeting its 3'UTR and promoter. The loss of stat5b completely abolished the elevated growth performance in chr23-miR-200s-KO or dmrt1-/- zebrafish. Moreover, the dmrt1 transgenic zebrafish had significantly lower body length and body weight than the control males, accompanied by a significant reduction in stat5b expression in the liver of transgenic fish. In summary, our study proposes a regulatory model elucidating the roles of chr23-miR-200s and Dmrt1 in controlling the sexually dimorphic trade-off between reproduction and growth.\",\n",

Identifying the important symptoms of PTSS could help with informing future research to alleviate police officers' psychological problems. In this study, a two-wave on-line investigation (4 months interval; T1 and T2) was conducted with a sample of 891 Chinese police officers who completed the Chinese version of PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Cross-sectional network and cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) analyses were adopted. The results showed that: (1) The most central nodes all belonged to the hyper-arousal and the negative cognition and emotion alteration clusters in both T1 and T2. (2) The strongest positive predictive paths were apparent from symptoms in hyper-arousal cluster to symptoms in negative cognition and emotion alteration cluster and intrusions cluster. Hyperarousal is the core symptom cluster among police officers during COVID-19, and it positively predict negative cognition and emotion alteration symptoms and intrusions symptoms over time. Future research could focus more on these symptoms and examine their role in the onset and development of PTSS in police officers following traumatic events.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract The impacts of Internet use on farming productivity in China have been extensively examined. However, existing studies focus on non-grain crops and often do not distinguish between Internet access and Internet use. This study investigates the effects of both Internet access and Internet use for farming purposes on farmers’ technical efficiency (TE) using data collected from 855 grain-farmers in Central China. The TE is evaluated following a stochastic frontier analysis approach. Endogenous switching regression models are used to address the potential endogeneity issue associated with Internet access or use. Our empirical results show that the use of the Internet for obtaining farming-related information is crucial for improving farmers’ TE. Having access to the Internet itself does not necessarily improve TE. This is also true when considering the effects through the two channels of technology adoption and risk management. Furthermore, using the Internet for non-farming purposes could impede the improvement of TE. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the Internet can help to reduce the discrepancy of TE among grain farmers.',\n",

       "   'Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) is a constituent of the TGF-β superfamily, known for its ability to stimulate bone and cartilage formation. The investigation of bmp6’s involvement in the formation of intermuscular bones in fish has garnered significant attention in recent years. The rib cage is an important skeletal structure that plays a protective function for internal organs in fish. However, there has been limited research conducted on the effects of the bmp6 gene on rib development. Silver carp is one of four major fish in China, favoured for its affordability and tender muscle. Nevertheless, the presence of numerous intermuscular bones in silver carp significantly hinders the advancement of its palatability and suitability for processing. This study showcases the effective utilisation of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for the purpose of disrupting the bmp6 gene in silver carp, leading to the creation of chimeras in the P0 generation, marking the first instance of such an achievement. The chimeras exhibited complete viability, normal appearance, and partial intermuscular bones loss, with approximately 30% of them displaying rib bifurcation or bending. Subsequently, a transcriptome analysis on ribs of P0 chimeras and wild-type silver carp was conducted, leading to the identification of 934 genes exhibiting differential expression, of which 483 were found to be up-regulated and 451 were found to be down-regulated. The results of the KEGG analysis revealed that the “NF-kappa B signalling pathway”, “Hippo signalling pathway”, “osteoclast differentiation”, and “haematopoietic cell lineage” exhibited enrichment and displayed a significant correlation with bone development. The up-regulated genes such as tnfα, fos, and ctgf in pathways may facilitate the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts, whereas the down-regulation of genes such as tgfb2 and tgfbr1 in pathways may hinder the formation and specialisation of osteoblasts, ultimately resulting in rib abnormalities. This study presents novel findings on the impact of bmp6 gene deletion on the rib development of silver carp, while simultaneously investigating the previously unexplored molecular mechanisms underlying rib defects in fish.',\n",
       "   'Inflammation is critical for obesity and obesity-induced insulin resistance (IR). In this study, we reveal the function and mechanism of acarbose on adipose tissue macrophage (ATM)-mediated inflammation in obesity and obesity-induced IR. First, acarbose enhances the abundance of propionic acid-producing Parasutterella, therefore indirectly inhibiting the survival and proinflammatory function of M1-like ATMs via GPR43. Most interestingly, acarbose can directly inhibit M1-like ATM-mediated inflammation through GPR120. Diet-induced obese mice exhibit nitrobenzoxadiazoles (NBD) fluorescence-labeled ATMs, but lean mice that also orally received NBD fluorescence-labeled acarbose do not exhibit NBD fluorescence-labeled ATMs. This direct inhibition of macrophages by acarbose is validated in mouse and human macrophages in vitro. In conclusion, our study reveals that acarbose directly and indirectly inhibits proinflammatory macrophage phenotype, which contributes to the improvement of obesity and obesity-induced IR. The understanding of the immune regulatory effects of acarbose may extend its potential for further therapeutic applications.',\n",

       "   'Purpose This study aims to investigate how long commutes negatively affect employees’ creative deviance at work, exploring the mediating role that impaired work–life balance plays in linking commute to restricted creative deviance, as well as examining whether access to flexible work arrangements can alleviate commuting’s detrimental indirect effects. Design/methodology/approach This study employed a three-wave survey methodology conducted over monthly intervals with 246 participants in China’s Pearl River Delta region. Rigorous screening ensured a demographically diverse sample. Findings Commuting time negatively affects creative deviance, both directly and indirectly through work–life balance. Flexible work arrangements mitigate the adverse effects of long commutes on work–life balance, subsequently weakening the indirect effect of commuting time on creative deviance through work–life balance. Practical implications A holistic approach is suggested for organizations aiming to foster a supportive and ethical work environment, which involves a combination of organizational policies, leadership practices and individual actions to promote both creativity and employee welfare. Originality/value This research breaks new ground by identifying commuting time as a key factor influencing creative deviance in the workplace, mediated by work–life balance. It integrates transportation research with organizational behavior, applying an ethics of care perspective to challenge traditional paradigms. The study’s interdisciplinary approach, bridging multiple fields, provides a novel, holistic view of how non-work factors impact workplace innovation.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['This study examines the market penetration strategies of Mixue Ice Cream &amp; Tea in Laos, an emerging market in Southeast Asia. Using a qualitative case study approach, data were collected through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, including franchise owners, management representatives, and local distribution partners, supplemented by secondary data from company reports, industry publications, and market research. The findings reveal that Mixue’s success in Laos is driven by a combination of low-cost pricing, culturally relevant product adaptations, and an efficient franchise-based distribution model. These strategies have allowed the brand to effectively penetrate the Lao market, overcoming challenges posed by infrastructure limitations and competitive pressures. The study also demonstrates the importance of balancing global brand consistency with local customization, as Mixue has successfully adapted its marketing and product offerings to align with the preferences of Lao consumers while maintaining the core elements of its global identity. However, the company’s continued growth will depend on its ability to innovate and respond to evolving consumer preferences and increased competition in the market. The findings contribute to the literature on global brand adaptation and market penetration in emerging markets, offering practical insights for other businesses looking to expand in similar contexts.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Background: Peri-implantitis (PI) is a prevalent complication of implant treatment. Pyroptosis, a distinctive inflammatory programmed cell death, is crucial to the pathophysiology of PI. Despite its importance, the pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) influencing PI's progression remain largely unexplored. Methods: This study conducted histological staining and transcriptome analyze from three datasets. The intersection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and PRGs was identified as pyroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (PRDEGs). Functional enrichment analyses were conducted to shed light on potential underlying mechanisms. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and a pyroptotic macrophage model were utilized to identify and validate hub PRDEGs. Immune cell infiltration in PI and its relationship with hub PRDEGs were also examined. Furthermore, consensus clustering was performed to identify new PI subtypes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, mRNA-mRNA binding protein regulatory (RBP) network, and mRNA-drugs regulatory network of hub PRDEGs were also analyzed. Results: Eight hub PRDEGs were identified: PGF, DPEP1, IL36B, IFIH1, TCEA3, RIPK3, NET7 , and TLR3 , which are instrumental in the PI's progression. Two PI subtypes were distinguished, with Cluster 1 exhibiting higher immune cell activation. The exploration of regulatory networks provided novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets in PI. Conclusion: Our research highlights the critical role of pyroptosis and identifies eight hub PRDEGs in PI's progression, offering insights into novel immunotherapy targets and laying the foundation for advanced diagnostic and treatment strategies. This contributes to our understanding of PI and underscores the potential for personalized clinical management.

       "   'The use of occupational exoskeletons has grown fast in manufacturing industries in recent years. One major scenario of exoskeleton use in manufacturing is to assist overhead, power hand tool operations. This preliminary work aimed to determine the effects of arm-supporting exoskeletons on shoulder muscle activity and human-hand tool coupling in simulated overhead tasks with axially applied vibration. An electromagnetic shaker capable of producing the random vibration spectrum specified in ISO 10819 was hung overhead to deliver vibrations. Two passive, arm-supporting exoskeletons, with one (ExoVest) transferring load to both the shoulder and pelvic region while the second one (ExoStrap) transferring load primarily to the pelvic region, were used in testing. Testing was also done with the shaker placed in front of the body to better understand the posture and exoskeleton engagement effects. The results collected from 6 healthy male subjects demonstrate the dominating effects of the overhead working posture on increased shoulder muscle activities. Vibration led to higher muscle activities in both agonist and antagonist shoulder muscles to a less extent. Exoskeleton use reduced the anterior deltoid and serratus anterior activities by 27% to 43%. However, wearing the ExoStrap increased the upper trapezius activities by 23% to 38% in the overhead posture. Furthermore, an increased human-shaker handle coupling was observed in the OH posture when wearing the ExoVest, indicating a more demanding neuromuscular control.',\n",

       "   'In this study, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) human skeletal model coupled with knee, spine, and shoulder exoskeletons. The primary purpose of this model is to predict the optimal lifting motion and provide torque support from the exoskeleton through the utilization of inverse dynamics optimization. The kinematics and dynamics of the human model are expressed using the Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) representation. The lifting optimization formulation integrates the electromechanical dynamics of the DC motors in the exoskeletons of the knee, spine, and shoulder. The design variables for this study include human joint angle profiles and exoskeleton motor current profiles. The optimization objective is to minimize the squared normalized human joint torques, subject to physical and task-specific lifting constraints. We solve this optimization problem using the gradient-based optimizer SNOPT. Our results include a comparison of predicted human joint angle profiles, joint torque profiles, and ground reaction force (GRF) profiles between lifting tasks with and without exoskeleton assistance. We also explore various combinations of exoskeletons for the knee, spine, and shoulder. By resolving the lifting optimization problems, we designed the optimal torques for the exoskeletons located at the knee, spine, and shoulder. It was found that the support from the exoskeletons substantially lowers the torque levels in human joints. Additionally, we conducted experiments only on the knee exoskeleton. Experimental data indicated that using the knee exoskeleton decreases the muscle activation peaks by 35.00%, 10.03%, 22.12%, 30.14%, 16.77%, and 25.71% for muscles of the erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris, respectively.',\n",

       "   'The traditional finite element method (FEM) has limitations in accurately modeling crack propagation. Peridynamics, a nonlocal extension of the classical continuum theory, provides an alternative approach to remedy the limitations of the FEM but with a higher computational cost. In this paper, a peridynamic bond-based fatigue damage model is developed and incorporated into a commercial finite-element software (ABAQUS 2017) via user subroutines. Model-predicted results including the crack path spatial position and the damage accumulation rate were validated against empirical data. The predicted crack growth as a function of loading cycle and crack trajectory showed good agreement with the experimental data over 200,000 loading cycles. Therefore, the integration of the peridynamic bond-based fatigue damage model into existing FEM software provides an economical means to simulate complex fracture behaviors, such as crack growth, in a compact tension specimen examined in this paper.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Objectives: ROADS to FACTS summer camp was designed to teach high school students about STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) careers and offered them an opportunity to develop, practice and enhance college readiness. Methods: 29 high school students participated in a 1-week residential summer camp on the campus of Northern Illinois University (NIU). University students and outreach program staff led many different camp activities focusing on food, health, engineering, and computer science. The campers also learned about the college application process, different universities to attend, and different STEM majors to pursue. Additionally, the campers experienced college life while staying overnight in the dormitories for the seven-day period. At the end of the camp, the campers filled out an evaluation survey including demographic questions, 20 Likert-scale questions assessing the camp experience, and 6 open ended questions to provide qualitative feedback about the camp. Results: Camp participants were 62% females, 31% identified as Black, and 48% identified as Hispanics. The students had a positive and rewarding experience as indicated by majority of the campers (70%) selecting agree and strongly agree for the Likert scale questions. They enjoyed learning about food science and health careers, meeting new people, participating in field trips and other interactive activities, and experiencing college/dorm life. Majority of the campers expressed interest in pursuing nutrition and health related majors in college and are planning to seek admission in in-state universities with NIU being the most popular choice (50% campers). Conclusions: ROADS to FACTS camp brought together high school students that are passionate and wanted to learn more about STEM programs. The camp allowed students to participate in engaging activities, learn about new careers, and make new connections. Some students enjoyed the program more than others but the majority of students enjoyed their experience at the camp. The constructive feedback about the camp based on participants' experience can be used to improve the program for future implementation.

       "  'abstracts': ['Grandparent alienation is an intentional behavior in which a parent turns a child against a grandparent through emotional manipulation of the child. In this study, we explored alienation behaviors experienced, life satisfaction, relationship status, and help-seeking experiences of 551 adults who identified as alienated grandparents. Analysis included ANOVA, regression analysis, correlation, and thematic analysis of all participants’ responses to an open-ended question addressing help seeking. Life satisfaction was negatively affected by the number of alienating behaviors experienced. Grandchild brainwashing and withholding information about grandchildren significantly predicted life satisfaction in this sample as did relationship status and participant age. Thematic analysis revealed two main themes related to participants’ help-seeking experiences with counselors: (1) their yearning for support was satisfied through validation, coping skill acquisition, and engaging with an empathic listener, and (2) they experienced disappointment and frustration through clinician lack of experience and understanding. Implications and best practices for counselors are provided.'],\n",

       "   'This essay aims to elucidate effective teaching through the utilization of instructional models in physical education. In this essay, Rink’s seven essential teaching tasks provide the foundational structure, complemented by an examination of four legitimate student outcomes in physical education: physical, cognitive, social, and affective domains. A literature review of 222 research studies on teaching effectiveness of nine instructional models reporting on teacher behaviors and student outcomes was coded following a four-step reliability coding process to establish a consensus on the articles included. This essay serves as a resource for comprehending the application of instructional models in physical education curricula, highlighting the need for continuous research into their efficacy and the replication of studies to validate outcomes across various educational settings. In addition, it highlights the importance of integrating K–16 teacher assessment data within these models to demonstrate the educational impact across learning domains.',\n",
       "   \"In today's rapidly evolving educational environment, there is a pressing need to train teachers to respond to the increasingly diverse needs of students. Although physical education teacher education (PETE) programs across the country offer a wide variety of early field experiences for students, very few provide opportunities to work with currently incarcerated youths. One such partnership exists at Northern Illinois University (NIU), with a collaboration between the PETE program, the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice, and Project FLEX. Project FLEX is a physical activity and life skills program for incarcerated youths, one of the only current programs in the United States. The program's primary aims are to incorporate life skill content into sport programming that fosters the transfer of these skills outside of programming and to engage youth in activities that increased physical activity levels while encouraging improvements to their sedentary lifestyle. The purpose of this article is to highlight the partnership between Project FLEX, the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice, and the PETE program at NIU, discuss the partnership's impact on those involved, and share some potential future directions of the partnership. Further explanation of the interplay between the PETE program, the student's roles and responsibilities within Project FLEX, and how such early field experiences are currently situated within the PETE program will be discussed.\",\n",
       "   'Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a sport-leadership program on minority incarcerated young adults’ health-related fitness markers. Design/methodology/approach This study occurred at an all-male juvenile detention center. A total of 41 participants in this study were obtained from a sample of 103 incarcerated young adults. Data collection entailed body mass index (BMI) evaluation, cardiovascular endurance tests and 1-min pushups and situps at two different time periods (before and after three months). A 2 × 2 mixed factorial analysis of variances was used to test for differences among the within subjects’ factors (time [pre × post]) and between subjects’ factors (groups [flex × control]) for the above-mentioned dependent variables. Findings Over the course of three consecutive months of engagement, preliminary indications demonstrated participants had a slight reduction in BMI and significant increases in cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength. Contrarily, during this same time period, non-participating young adults exhibited significant increases in BMI and decreases in cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength. Originality/value Integration of sport-leadership programs is generally not free but can be a low-cost alternative for combatting many issues surrounding physical activity, weight gain and recreational time for those incarcerated.',\n",
       "   'The purpose of this study was to examine if the inclusion of a group-based contingency involving social media would have a positive impact on a cohort of middle school students’ out-of-school physical activity. Ninety-two eighth-grade students (50 females, 42 males; average age = 12.98) from three physical education classes in a middle school in the Midwest region of the United States participated in a 22-lesson Sport Education season of disc golf (an activity selected by students). During the competitive parts of the season, students were able to earn bonus points for their teams by practicing outside of school time with family/friends, or with members of their class. For these points to be registered on the class league table, at some point while playing, students would create a Snapchat story which they then sent to their classmates and the teacher. Out-of-school activity was measured by each student wearing a Yamax DigiWalker SW 701 pedometer. Results showed significant increases in out-of-school step counts during those phases of the season in which the Snapchat contingency resulted in team points accrual. These results provide support for the utility of providing group-oriented contingencies within Sport Education, as they appear to be an effective and authentic context for promoting autonomous out-of-school time physical activity.',\n",
       "   'Aim: Social media leisure time activities have become a very popular activity in Worldwide, and with an increase in social media use research has shown a similar decline in physical participation and a decrease in aerobic capacity. Decreases in physical activity time have been positivity associated with an increase for all-cause mortality and the increased risk development for obesity and cardiovascular disease conditions. Methods: A sample of the Northern Illinois student body (n = 161) was examined for associations between social media time on markers of aerobic fitness capacity and daily physical activity. Institution Review Board consent was given, and subjects then were asked to complete a 7-day recall to assess their social media usage, which was interview administered, had a bioimpedance analysis scan, completed a PACER aerobic fitness test, and wore a pedometer for seven days to assess steps per day. Results: Subjects were classified depending on their social media time usage as infrequent users, moderate users, and frequent users by percentile ranks. PACER scores were reduced in the frequent users compared to the infrequent users and this was statistically significant (p = .027). Steps per day exhibited similar trends with a decreased step count per day for the frequent users compared to the infrequent users (p = .023). Conclusions: College students who engage in a greater volume of social media use per day displayed a greater decrease in aerobic fitness as assessed by the PACER test and exhibited a greater decline in physical activity quantified by steps taken per day.',\n",

This commentary develops several possible extensions to this interesting line of research with a goal of more specifically identifying the mechanisms that account for the relationships between prohibitions and adolescents' peer adjustment. Future investigations can build on this research by considering the role of conflict between parents and adolescents as a potential mediator or moderator in the process of prohibiting and considering the meaning of restrictive peer access to adolescents' peers across the developmental period. Further, investigations could consider daily diary and observational approaches to expand the field to better understand prohibitions at a microlevel. The commentary also encourages investigators to more fully examine bidirectionality, specifically child effects, which have received relatively little attention in this area.\",\n",
       "   'The ways in which Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms lead to impairments in functioning, including academic performance, are not well understood. The present study sought to examine the role of a common maladaptive coping strategy, experiential avoidance, as a moderator of the relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and academic achievement. Participants ( N = 326) were undergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology courses at a large university in the Midwestern United States who reported at least one event potentially meeting Criterion A for PTSD. The prospective association of PTSS with current and subsequent semester GPAs, and with experiential avoidance as the moderator, were examined. The interaction between PTSS and experiential avoidance significantly predicted both current semester GPA and subsequent semester GPA, with stronger associations between PTSS and GPA being observed at higher levels of experiential avoidance. These results were not fully explained by control variables of high school performance, standardized test scores, and general negative affect. This study found that experiential avoidance significantly moderates the relationship between PTSS and academic performance. These results suggest that interventions that target PTSS and/or experiential avoidance may increase GPA. Limitations and future directions are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract Continental large igneous provinces are among the largest magmatic events on Earth, characteristically manifesting at the surface as stacks of monotonous flood basalt lavas that form through a dynamic pattern of eruptive pulses separated by hiatuses. Such dynamic patterns may be difficult to detect from the composition of the lavas. Instead, lava crystal cargoes can be used to study how the eruption cycles inherent to continental large igneous provinces are moderated by episodic recharge and evacuation at multiple crustal levels. Here, we present a stratigraphically well-constrained series of 56 flood basalt flows from the Eocene Initial Phase of magmatic activity in East Africa. These flows and their crystal cargo permit temporal insight into the development of one of the youngest and best-preserved continental large igneous provinces. The stratiform mafic lavas exposed in northern Kenya consist of alternating aphyric and plagioclase-phyric lava packages consistent with periods of eruption punctuated by volcanic hiatus, where magmas stall and crystallize plagioclase at medium to shallow crustal levels. Plagioclase compositions (n = 541) exhibit little intra-crystal or intra-sample compositional diversity. Intra-crystal equilibrium calculations for Sr and Ti indicate internal chemical equilibrium, requiring storage at high temperatures over a prolonged time interval (10 000–100 000 years). Using a series of seven interlinked partial crystal fractionation models under equilibrium conditions, we replicate the observed stratigraphic patterns in plagioclase composition. We find that the balance between recharge, evacuation, and diffusive equilibration within a shallow magmatic system controls the composition of plagioclase in these flood basalts. We conclude that the shallow fractionation system modulates eruptive cycles and thus constitutes a critical component in studies of continental large igneous provinces.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['In geminiviruses belonging to the genus Begomovirus, coat protein (CP) expression depends on viral AL2 protein, which derepresses and activates the CP promoter through sequence elements that lie within the viral intergenic region (IR). However, AL2 does not exhibit sequence-specific DNA binding activity but is instead directed to responsive promoters through interactions with host factors, most likely transcriptional activators and/or repressors. In this study, we describe a repressive plant-specific transcription factor, Arabidopsis thaliana TCP24 (AtTCP24), that interacts with AL2 and recognizes a class II TCP binding site in the CP promoter (GTGGTCCC). This motif corresponds to the previously identified conserved late element (CLE). We also report that histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), an epigenetic mark associated with facultative repression, is enriched over the viral IR. H3K27me3 is deposited by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a critical regulator of gene expression and development in plants and animals. Remarkably, mutation of the TCP24 binding site (the CLE) in tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) and cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) CP promoters greatly diminishes H3K27me3 levels on viral chromatin and causes a dramatic delay and attenuation of disease symptoms in infected Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Symptom remission is accompanied by decreased viral DNA levels in systemically infected tissue. Nevertheless, in transient replication assays CLE mutation delays but does not limit the accumulation of viral double-stranded DNA, although single-stranded DNA and CP mRNA levels are decreased. These findings suggest that TCP24 binding to the CLE leads to CP promoter repression and H3K27me3 deposition, while TCP24-AL2 interaction may recruit AL2 to derepress and activate the promoter. Thus, a repressive host transcription factor may be repurposed to target a viral factor essential for promoter activity. The presence of the CLE in many begomoviruses suggests a common scheme for late promoter regulation.'],\n",

       "   \"ObjectiveThe three-dimensional morphological structures of periodontal ligaments (PDLs) are important data for periodontal, orthodontic, prosthodontic, and implant interventions. This study aimed to employ a deep learning (DL) algorithm to segment the PDL automatically in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).MethodThis was a retrospective study. We randomly selected 389 patients and 1734 axial CBCT images from the CBCT database, and designed a fully automatic PDL segmentation computer-aided model based on instance segmentation Mask R-CNN network. The labels of the model training were 'teeth' and 'alveolar bone', and the 'PDL' is defined as the region where the 'teeth' and 'alveolar bone' overlap. The model's segmentation performance was evaluated using CBCT data from eight patients outside the database.ResultsQualitative evaluation indicates that the PDL segmentation accuracy of incisors, canines, premolars, wisdom teeth, and implants reached 100%. The segmentation accuracy of molars was 96.4%. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the mIoU and mDSC of PDL segmentation were 0.667 ± 0.015 (>0.6) and 0.799 ± 0.015 (>0.7) respectively.ConclusionThis study analysed a unique approach to AI-driven automatic segmentation of PDLs on CBCT imaging, possibly enabling chair-side measurements of PDLs to facilitate periodontists, orthodontists, prosthodontists, and implantologists in more efficient and accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract Cutting temperature is playing a key role in evaluating the cutting process, which significantly affects the tool wear and the quality of the workpiece. Aiming at the problems of low precision, low aging, and poor stability of cutting temperature measurement on the front tool face, an integrated design and production scheme of a high sensitivity built-in wireless temperature measurement tool was proposed. The temperature distribution position on the front tool face was analyzed with 3D finite element simulation software, and the thermal contact position of the main and secondary film thermocouples was determined. SiO2 insulated films and NiCr/NiSi film thermocouples were prepared on the front tool surface by femtosecond laser micromachining, electrolyte-plasma polishing, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering, and a static calibration experiment system for sensitivity and accuracy of the temperature measuring tool for the film thermocouple was established, and Seebeck coefficient of the film thermocouple was obtained. According to the actual cutting conditions, the wireless temperature measuring system of the thin film thermocouple tool was built and the field cutting test was carried out to obtain the influence law of different cutting parameters on the cutting temperature, and further verify the feasibility of the thin film temperature measuring sensor. The research results show that: Seebeck coefficients of the two kinds of thermocouples prepared by the NiCr/NiSi thin film thermocouple temperature measuring tool are 34.97 μV/°C and 34.96 μV/°C, and the slope of the temperature data fitting curve is 1.00398 and 0.997475, respectively. The linear correlation coefficient R2 is close to 1, which is close to the standard K-type thermocouple, which shows good sensitivity and accuracy. At the same time, the temperature measurement results are close to the commercial standard K thermocouple, and the error is less than 5%, indicating that the developed film thermocouple has a high measurement accuracy and can meet the needs of temperature measurement. Actual cutting test is carried out with developed wireless temperature measuring device of thin film thermocouple, which shows this device can meet the requirements of tool temperature measurement, and the feasibility of thin film temperature measuring sensor is further verified. The research provide technical reference for industrial intelligent manufacturing in order to realize the wireless measurement of cutting area temperature of tool front.',\n",
       "   \"One grand challenge for deploying porous carbons with embedded metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) moieties as platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is their fast degradation and inferior activity. Here, we report the modulation of the local environment at Fe–N4 sites via the application of atomic Sn–Nx sites for simultaneously improved durability and activity. We discovered that Sn–Nx sites not only promote the formation of the more stable D2 FeN4C10 sites but also invoke a unique D3 SnNx–FeIIN4 site that is characterized by having atomically dispersed bridged Sn–Nx and Fe–N4. This new D3 site exhibits significantly improved stability against demetalation and several times higher turnover frequency for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the shift of the reaction pathway from a single-site associative mechanism to a dual-site dissociative mechanism with the adjacent Sn site facilitating a lower overpotential cleavage of the O–O bond. This mechanism bypasses the formation of the otherwise inevitable intermediate that is responsible for demetalation, where two hydroxyl intermediates bind to one Fe site. As a result, a mesoporous Fe/Sn-PNC catalyst exhibits a positively shifted ORR half-wave potential and more than 50% lower peroxide formation. This, in combination with the stable D3 site and enriched D2 Fe sites, significantly enhanced the catalyst's durability as demonstrated in membrane electrode assemblies using complementary accelerated durability testing protocols.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Discrete-edge end milling cutters are a new type of tool that regularly grinds a certain number of chip breaking grooves on the circumferential edge. The original cutting state is changed due to the presence of chip breaking grooves. In order to further explore the milling performance of the type of tools, discrete-edge end milling cutters with chip breaking grooves are designed and simulated by using NUM software. Then, they are processed and ground by using SAACKE five axis grinding machine. Orthogonal milling experiments were established using aluminum alloy samples as the processing object and an end milling cutter of the same specification without chip breaking grooves as a control group. Combined with modal parameter identification experiments and milling force coefficient experimental data, time-domain analysis was used to solve the stability of the milling system and blade diagrams were drawn. In addition, vibration signals, milling forces and chip shapes were analyzed. The results show that the minimum limit axial cutting depth of the discrete-edge end milling cutters are about 20% higher than that of the conventional end milling cutter within the same radial cutting width and calculated spindle speed. It shows that the milling stable area of the discrete-edge end milling cutters are larger and have a wider scope of application. At the same time, due to the existence of the chip breaker, it can effectively break chips and facilitate chips removal.',\n",

       "   'Background:Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been receiving increasing attention in developed countries.The purpose of this study was to investigate understanding of menopause and acceptance of MHT in Qinhuangdao, China. Material/Methods:We analyzed data from 186 perimenopausal patients on topics including menopausal symptoms and acceptance of and adherence to MHT treatment.We also surveyed 100 medical staff on menopausal-related knowledge. Results:Group A consisted of 41 patients treated with MHT for more than 1 cycle, group B consisted of 49 patients who had received MHT but had stopped it for more than 3 months, and group C consisted of 96 patients who never received MHT.There was a significant difference among them in modified Kupermann scores before treatment (P<0.05), but the difference disappeared after MHT (P>0.05).In group C, 32 patients (33%) were unaware of MHT, 60 (62.5%) were worried about the risk of breast/endometrial cancer, 24 (25%) were worried about high costs, and 67 (70%) had no obvious symptoms and did not want MHT.Similarly, in group B, most people stopped MHT for fear of breast or endometrial cancer.A survey targeting 100 medical staff in our hospital found 14 people (14%) knew about and were willing to accept MHT, 44 people (44%) knew about MHT but were afraid to use it, and 42 people (42%) did not know about MHT at all. Conclusions:MHT has not yet been accepted by the majority of people, even medical staff, in Qinhuangdao, China, and much further progress is needed.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Many challenges in lithium‐sulfur (Li–S) batteries are associated with the radical change in lithium polysulfide (LPS) solubility during cycling, but chemical approaches to address such inconsistency are still lacking. Here, the use of a strong Lewis acidic fluorinated organoboron, tri(2,2,2‐trifluoroethyl) borate (TFEB), is reported as a multi‐functional mediator to simultaneously overcome multiple technical barriers in practical Li–S batteries. TFEB acts as an anion acceptor and forms strong molecular complexes with Lewis basic LPS. The TFEB‐LPS complexes have consistent solubility across the full polysulfide spectrum and deliver several times improved better redox kinetics, unlocking a true redox catalytic mechanism that covers the majority of redox events in thick sulfur cathodes. As a result, Li–S batteries evaluated under practical conditions exhibit significantly improved discharge capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability with the addition of the TFEB additive. More importantly, TFEB also contributes to the stabilization of lithium anode in the presence of polysulfides by generating strong interfacial film. These attributes significantly improve the cycling stability of practical Li–S pouch cells, which are assembled with a unit energy density of 219 Wh kg −1 . The results provide new molecular insights on the design of unlocking solvation networks of practical Li–S systems.',\n",
       "   'Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) is a major disease affecting banana production around the globe. To study the movement of Foc in planta and investigate potential physical mechanisms of deterrence, the roots of a set of banana cultivars were challenged with a GFP-tagged subtropical race 4 strain of Foc. These plants included susceptible and resistant varieties including the plantain &amp;#039;FHIA25&amp;#039; (AAB), dessert hybrids &amp;#039;Lady Finger&amp;#039; (AAB), &amp;#039;FHIA02&amp;#039; (AAAA), as well as the industry preferred Cavendish line, &amp;#039;Williams&amp;#039; (AAA), and its somaclone derivative &amp;#039;GCTCV119&amp;#039; (AAA). GFP localisation in planta confirmed that Foc can infect all four cultivars. Its movement through roots to the rhizome and to the aerial parts of the plants was evident. Tyloses formation in the root vasculature was also detected by GFP auto-fluorescence and further confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. While tyloses formation did not prevent colonisation and infection, their formation restricted the fungus within the xylem vessels, slowing its proliferation. This mechanism may be an important factor in providing plant host tolerance to Foc but it doesn&amp;#039;t provide complete immunity. Fluorescently tagged Foc is a useful tool for understanding the infection process of the Fusarium wilt disease of banana and aiding in the integrated management of this important disease.',\n",
       "   \"Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), poses a significant threat to global banana production. This study used a GFP-tagged subtropical race 4 strain of Foc (GFP-Foc-STR4) to trace the pathogen's movement in different banana cultivars. These include a race 4 resistant cultivar FHIA25 and the Cavendish somaclone 'GCTCV119', as well as susceptible cultivars including 'Lady Finger', 'FHIA02', and 'Williams' Cavendish. GFP localization revealed that GFP-Foc-STR4 was able to infect all tested cultivars, moving from the roots to the rhizome and aerial parts of the plant. Tyloses formation in root and rhizome vasculature, visualised with GFP autofluorescence and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, was found to restrict Foc within the xylem vessels, slowing its spread but not fully preventing infection. This containment mechanism contributes to the host tolerance of 'FHIA25' and 'GCTCV119', though it does not confer complete immunity. The use of the fluorescently tagged Foc strain provides valuable insight into the infection process, and supports efforts in the integrated management of Fusarium wilt of banana.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Background: The growing emphasis on immunology in oncology and other therapeutic areas has increased the importance of modeling flow cytometry data. For example, subasumstat (TAK-981) has been shown to stimulate CD69 expression on NK cells both in vitro and in the peripheral blood of cancer patients in a Phase I clinical trial (NCT03648372) . Typically, we would use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD69 or the percent CD69 positive (%+) on NK cells. However, flow cytometry data shows the distribution of CD69 fluorescence intensities right-shifting and spreading under subasumstat administration, reflecting a stochastic process, from gene to mRNA to protein expression, that cannot be fully captured by ODE modeling. Methods: Starting with a chemical master equation (CME), we derive a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the distribution of CD69 expression on the NK cell population in a patient after a single dose of subasumstat. We then attempt to find necessary conditions for the model to be consistent with three key clinical observations: (a) homeostasis before treatment, (b) response to treatment, and (c) return of the distribution to the original homeostatic CD69 distribution. Results: Theoretical as well as empirical comparison to the observed CD69 expression distributions at pre-dose, 24 hours after first dose, and 4 days after the second BIW dose (day 4) provided a relationship between the functional forms of the coefficients of the PDE required to fit the observed data. Conclusions: The approach used is able to describe the evolution of the distribution of CD69 expression on NK cell populations in individual patients while constraining the parameter ranges that fit the data. This procedure can be generalized to establish conditions and parameter values allowing characterization of pre-treatment homeostasis and on-treatment dynamics of immune cell biomarker distributions as determined by flow cytometry. By capturing the richness of flow cytometry data (as opposed to modeling a scalar quantity such as MFI or %+), this approach can provide better quantification of key immunological processes in vitro, in vivo, and in patients.Citations: [1] A Study of TAK-981 in People With Advanced Solid Tumors or Cancers of the Immune System, NCT03648372, clinicaltrials.gov.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) has advanced significantly, yet accurately predicting clad characteristics from processing parameters remains challenging due to process complexity and data scarcity. This study introduces a novel hybrid machine learning (ML) framework that integrates validated multi-physics computational fluid dynamics simulations with experimental data, enabling prediction of clad characteristics unattainable through conventional methods alone. Our approach uniquely incorporates physics-aware features, such as volumetric energy density and linear mass density, enhancing process understanding and model transferability. We comprehensively benchmark ML models across traditional, ensemble, and neural network categories, analyzing their computational complexity through Big O notation and evaluating both classification and regression performance in predicting clad geometries and process maps. The framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy with sub-second inference latency, overcoming limitations of purely experimental or simulation-based methods. The trained models generate processing maps with 0.95 AUC (Area Under Curve) accuracy that directly guide MAM parameter selection, bridging the gap between theoretical modeling and practical process control. By integrating physics-based simulations with ML techniques and physics-aware features, our approach achieves an R2 of 0.985 for clad geometry prediction and improved generalization over traditional methods, establishing a new standard for MAM process modeling. This research advances both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of MAM processes through a comprehensive, physics-aware machine learning approach.',\n",

       "   \"This study aimed to analyze brain activity during various STEM activities, exploring the feasibility of classifying between different tasks. EEG brain data from twenty subjects engaged in five cognitive tasks were collected and segmented into 4-second clips. Power spectral densities of brain frequency waves were then analyzed. Testing different k-intervals with XGBoost, Random Forest, and Bagging Classifier revealed that Random Forest performed best, achieving a testing accuracy of 91.07% at an interval size of two. When utilizing all four EEG channels, cognitive flexibility was most recognizable. Task-specific classification accuracy showed the right frontal lobe excelled in mathematical processing and planning, the left frontal lobe in cognitive flexibility and mental flexibility, and the left temporoparietal lobe in connections. Notably, numerous connections between frontal and temporoparietal lobes were observed during STEM activities. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of implementing machine learning in analyzing brain activity and sheds light on the brain's mechanisms.\",\n",

       "   \"This study investigated the use of forearm EMG data for distinguishing eight hand gestures, employing the Neural Network and Random Forest algorithms on data from ten participants. The Neural Network achieved 97 percent accuracy with 1000-millisecond windows, while the Random Forest achieved 85 percent accuracy with 200-millisecond windows. Larger window sizes improved gesture classification due to increased temporal resolution. The Random Forest exhibited faster processing at 92 milliseconds, compared to the Neural Network's 124 milliseconds. In conclusion, the study identified a Neural Network with a 1000-millisecond stream as the most accurate (97 percent), and a Random Forest with a 200-millisecond stream as the most efficient (85 percent). Future research should focus on increasing sample size, incorporating more hand gestures, and exploring different feature extraction methods and modeling algorithms to enhance system accuracy and efficiency.\",\n",

Executive functions (EF) and critical thinking overlap, where the latter often rely on the proficient operation of EF and vice versa. Extending the simple view of reading, the active view of reading considers the contribution of language comprehension and decoding to reading comprehension by including the role of EF. In the present study, we assess 360 seventh-grade English language learners attending schools in three states in India. We gathered measures of reading comprehension, critical thinking and listening comprehension, reading fluency, academic vocabulary, and encoding. Using multiple regression to fit a linear model, the best-fit model explained 59.3% of the total variance in reading comprehension. Two indicators of critical thinking, induction and deduction, were significant predictors of reading comprehension, along with listening comprehension, encoding, and academic vocabulary. Also of interest was the result showing reading fluency to be a non-significant predictor of reading comprehension. Results of this study add empirical support for the role of critical thinking in reading comprehension.',\n",
       "   \"AbstractThis study explores the effectiveness of dynamic assessment (DA) in addressing grammatical writing difficulties in Pakistani English as a Second Language (ESL) learners' writing. Adopting an interactionist approach to DA, the research observes mediational moves by a teacher during the writing assessment process. The study employs a qualitative case study design, examining the interactional patterns and outcomes of DA for three higher secondary-level Pakistani ESL learners over an eight-week period. The findings indicate that the interactionist approach to DA is a promising method for improving the grammatical accuracy of Pakistani ESL learners, particularly in areas such as tenses, pronouns, and subject-verb agreement. The results of this study have significant implications for writing instruction in ESL contexts. Dynamic assessment can support the development of writing skills by providing ESL writers with opportunities to engage in distributive practice and receive feedback on their writing, resulting in a tailored and effective approach to writing instruction.\",\n",

       "   'The Supreme Court’s decision in The Slaughter-House Cases was released a day after the single bloodiest racial massacre in the history of Reconstruction. Mere miles from the slaughterhouse at constitutional issue, a White mob murdered scores of Black Republicans in Colfax, Louisiana at the encouragement of Democratic gubernatorial candidate John McEnery. The Colfax Massacre took place on Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, and effectively ended Reconstruction in Louisiana. When the Court three years later overturned the convictions of the massacre’s ringleaders, it cited Slaughter-House. Few ideas have proven more generative or inspirational on the American left than abolition democracy. As articulated by W.E.B. Du Bois in his magisterial Black Reconstruction, abolition democracy encompasses two closely related concepts. It was a large-Republican political bloc that emerged after the Civil War and played a leading role in Reconstruction. It is a political aspiration to build a small-r republican polity that is free of racialized domination. The coalition’s “splendid failure” to realize the aspiration was confirmed when Northern industrial capital withdrew its support for Reconstruction and the federal government withdrew troops from the former Confederate states. This Essay draws upon Du Bois’s concepts of abolition democracy and his account of the relationship between constitutionalism, economic power, and violence to understand and evaluate The Slaughter-House Cases and the work of the Reconstruction Court afresh.',\n",
       "   \"This Essay uses the horror video game Alan Wake 2 as a jumping-off point to discuss and critique horrifying jurisprudence—accounts of law that evoke the emotion of horror. By centering on a horror writer whose storytelling shapes the real world, Alan Wake 2 invites analogies to legal interpretation. Legal interpretation often involves storytelling and produces real-life horrors. No legal philosopher captures the narrative and horrific elements of lawmaking as vividly as Robert Cover. Challenging Ronald Dworkin's optimistic account of judges as chain-novelists who can creatively bend the arc of the law towards justice, Cover contends that judges are generally uncreative members of violence-dispensing organizations. They spend most of their time killing—physically and metaphysically, destroying bodies and entire worlds. More horrific still is the vision articulated by the most memorable character in Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, Judge Holden. The Judge embraces as inevitable the killing that Cover laments and denies a hope that Cover left open—that of messianic legal transformation from without the system.Although Alan Wake 2 isn't about jurisprudence, it depicts transformative acts of democratic storytelling for which there are analogues in ongoing resistance to unjust legal systems. As horrific as legal systems can be, things are not so bad as Cover and McCarthy suggest. We can transform what might appear to be inescapable loops of domination into empowering spirals. We don't have to create horrors.\",\n",
       "   'Relying on 1868 abortion statutes, the 2022 Supreme Court held in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that no federal constitutional right to abortion exists. Mere months later, a petition for certiorari asked the Court to determine that “person” in the Fourteenth Amendment includes prenatal existence, which would require criminalization of abortion in all states. The petitioners cited Dobbs and claimed the authority of legal history in 1868 and before. These arguments will be heard again, and they are increasingly framed in terms of the “original public meaning” of the Fourteenth Amendment. This Article refutes these arguments on their own terms. It looks at 1868, but it doesn’t stop at statutes, treatises, or dictionaries. Instead, it looks at the reality of pregnancy in 1868, as experienced by the public—in particular, by women and their doctors. This was a reality full of ambiguities. Pregnancy was not medically diagnosable until quickening; ideas of prenatal development were fluid and women let doctors take their miscarried fetal tissue and stillborn babies away for scientific study; and pregnancy loss was common, expected, and impossible to distinguish from abortion. Women and their doctors lived these ambiguities. Nothing in the laws in 1868 changed them. These ambiguities similarly negate any possibility that the original public meaning of “person” in the Fourteenth Amendment included prenatal existence.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['This paper presents an analysis of the differences between written text and the transcription of spoken text using current Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The purpose of the study is to investigate the long and rich history of attempts to differentiate spoken and written text in fields such as linguistics, communication, and rhetoric, which date back to the early 20th century. Given the availability of large quantities of machine-readable data and machine learning algorithms that can handle them, it is possible to use a large number of derived features. The research focuses on syntactic and lexical differences in written books and transcriptions of speeches by United States presidents. The analysis investigates morphological, lexical, syntactical, and text-level aspects. In this process, multiple features have been considered including lexical diversity, syllable count, frequency of parts of speech, and features relating to the parse tree, like the average length of noun phrases, and the use of interrogative sentences, among others. This study will enhance our understanding of the difference between written text and the transcription of spoken text in various disciplines including computer science, applied linguistics, communication, and similar fields.',\n",

       "   \"With the development of China's financial and capital markets, more and more investors will choose to use different asset pricing models to analyze the effectiveness of their investments. Under the background of efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), this paper will use Fama-French three-factor model, GARCH family model and Heston model to analyze the validity and feasibility of these three commonly used models in Chinese market. Through empirical analysis, descriptive statistics and other research methods, it is found that all three models are effective but have certain limitations. It is found that the Fama-French three-factor model is too dependent on the market. The establishment of the GRACH family model is too complicated due to too many influencing factors in the market; and the time lag of the Heston model. All three models require investors to include more model analysis to get the optimal investment strategy. Therefore, this paper draws the definition of behavioral finance at the end of the paper, according to which investors' decisions can be further analyzed.\"],\n",

Students should grasp the new rules and understand how the nuances of manufacturing contracts (e.g., number of performance obligations, transaction price allocation, shipment options, product customization, and contract cancelation and compensation) can affect the recording and timing (over time or point in time) of revenue recognition. This case also encourages students to independently research the technical aspects of U.S. GAAP regarding the accounting treatment of these contracts.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Swash plate axial piston pumps play an important role in hydraulic systems due to their superior performance and compact design. As the controlled object of the valve-controlled hydraulic cylinder, the swash plate is affected by the complex fluid dynamics effect and the mechanical structure, which is prone to vibration, during the working process, thereby adversely affecting the dynamic performance of the system. In this paper, an electronically controlled ball screw type variable displacement mechanism with stiffness compensation is proposed. By introducing piezoelectric ceramic materials into the nut assembly, dynamic stiffness compensation of the system is achieved, which effectively changes the vibration characteristics of the swash plate and thus significantly improves the working stability of the system. Based on this, the stiffness model of a double nut ball screw is established to obtain the relationship between piezoelectric ceramics and the double nut. An asymmetric Bouc–Wen piezoelectric actuator model with nonlinear hysteresis characteristics is also established, and a particle swarm algorithm with improved inertia weights is utilized to identify the parameters of the asymmetric Bouc–Wen model. Finally, a piezoelectric actuator model based on the feedforward inverse model and a PID composite control algorithm is applied to the variable displacement mechanism system for stiffness compensation.',\n",
       "   'This paper proposes a variable mechanism structure based on a ball screw design for precise displacement control in axial piston pumps, with the objective of improving actuator position and velocity control within the displacement-controlled (DC) systems. Traditional valve-controlled cylinder variable mechanisms (VCCVM) often suffer from limited control precision over the swash plate due to numerous uncertain parameters within the hydraulic system. To address this issue, a ball screw is utilized to replace the original valve-controlled cylinder for swash plate control, enhancing accuracy and responsiveness. In addition, an in-depth analysis of the Ball Screw Variable Mechanism (BSVM) is conducted, leading to the development of a coupled mechanical-hydraulic dynamic model. Based on this model, a controller is designed to improve system performance. Finally, the effectiveness and high performance of the proposed new structure and control strategy were validated through comparative experiments and simulations. The experimental results confirm the advantages of the proposed design, demonstrating satisfactory improvements in control precision.',\n",

In this study, the effect of these perturbations are analyzed via computational fluid dynamics simulations of a square, two-dimensional, lid driven cavity containing varying area fractions of suspended particles. The evolution over time of these particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions generate two-dimensional disturbance velocity changes in the flow field. In order to better understand the characteristics and effects of these changes, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis is performed on the velocity difference flow field to determine the dominant flow structures over the simulation time domain. The resulting eigenvectors and eigenvalues represent the varying dominant flow structures and their respective dominance over the simulation time, respectively. This is carried out at particle suspension area fractions from 10\\\\% - 50\\\\% and for Reynolds numbers of 100, 400, 700, and 1000. Critical flow regimes and particle suspension area fractions are discussed in order to characterize the stability of this particle-in-fluid system.',\n",

Quantitative data is obtained based on the questionnaire results of 125 students from 5 schools in Surakarta, while qualitative data is in the form of in-depth interviews of 5 students. The questionnaire results show significant impacts in increasing students’ understanding about local indigenous knowledge and its connection with scientific explanation. Then, the in-depth interviews indicates that students are happy and have interest in learning with ethnoscience. This paper also contributes to cultural preservation by providing indigenous knowledge as well as scientific understanding by linking culture with science.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Global literacy partnerships between the Global North and Global South inevitably reside in the expansive waters of neoliberal reforms and coloniality. Global North and Global South literacy educators within global literacy partnerships must decolonize life through a liberatory praxis whereby they are convinced of the right and the duty to fight, to denounce and to announce. Nonviolent Communication, with its focus on speaking honestly and listening empathetically, provides a framework for cultivating the criticality, awareness, and connection needed to disrupt neoliberal reforms and coloniality within partnerships. Through NVC, the everyday dialogic experiences of Global North and Global South educators can generate a “power with” relationship instead of a “power over” relationship of oppression and coloniality.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract Fast simulation of the energy depositions in high-granular detectors is needed for future collider experiments at ever-increasing luminosities. Generative machine learning (ML) models have been shown to speed up and augment the traditional simulation chain in physics analysis. However, the majority of previous efforts were limited to models relying on fixed, regular detector readout geometries. A major advancement is the recently introduced CaloClouds model, a geometry-independent diffusion model, which generates calorimeter showers as point clouds for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the envisioned International Large Detector (ILD). In this work, we introduce CaloClouds II which features a number of key improvements. This includes continuous time score-based modelling, which allows for a 25-step sampling with comparable fidelity to CaloClouds while yielding a 6× speed-up over Geant4 on a single CPU (5× over CaloClouds ). We further distill the diffusion model into a consistency model allowing for accurate sampling in a single step and resulting in a 46× speed-up over Geant4 (37× over CaloClouds ). This constitutes the first application of consistency distillation for the generation of calorimeter showers.',\n",
       "   'A neural network for software compensation was developed for the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL). The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"The cause of the speed-accuracy tradeoff (typically quantified via Fitts' Law) is a debated topic of interest in motor neuroscience, and is commonly studied using tools from control theory. Two prominent theories involve the presence of signal dependent motor noise and planning variability -- these factors are generally incorporated separately. In this work, we study how well the simultaneous presence of both factors explains the speed-accuracy tradeoff. A human arm reaching model is developed with bio-realistic signal dependent motor noise, and a Gaussian noise model is used to deterministically approximate the motor noise. Both offline trajectory optimization and online model predictive control are used to simulate the planning and execution of several different reaching tasks with varying target sizes and movement durations. These reaching trajectories are then compared to experimental human reaching data, revealing that both models produce behavior consistent with humans, and the speed-accuracy tradeoff is present in both online and offline control. These results suggest the speed-accuracy tradeoff is likely caused by a combination of these two factors, and also that it plays a role in both offline and online computation.\"],\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

We analysed three different cases: a) the primary knock-on atom (PKA) is centered between both dislocations, b) the PKA is closer to one of the dislocations, and c) the PKA is on top of one of the dislocations and directed towards it. Our calculations show enhanced formation of vacancy clusters in the bulk for intermediate distances due to the absorption of self-interstitials by the dislocation during the collision cascade reducing the recombination between vacancies and self-interstitials. This effect results in the formation of jogs at the dislocation and the consequent climb due to the absorption of the self-interstitials. As a result, there is an unbalance between vacancies and self-interstitials produced by the collision cascade, with a significantly larger number of vacancies than self-interstitials in the bulk and the formation of large vacancy clusters. When the collision cascade develops directly on top of the dislocation, jogs are formed due to both the absorption of vacancies and self-interstitials, inducing climb and with the total dislocation length increasing up to several nanometers.',\n",

Implementing an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, 26 ELs completed five funds-of-knowledge-featured narrative writing essays in ten weeks operating under a switching replications quasi-experimental design. When controlling for the five writing topics, the results from mixed-effects multilevel modeling analysis revealed statistically significant and positive effects of the MBWT on the development of the ELs’ writing skills. The results also showed that the effect of the MBWT on writing performance was stronger for male students than for females. Findings of a follow-up qualitative research phase indicated that ELs had positive perceptions toward the adoption of the MBWT. Potential factors that influenced the integrated learning and gender effects were explored as well. This study is significant for engaging teachers in exploring the potential of designing and implementing inclusive mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) for diverse ethnic-minority student populations.',\n",

Findings illustrate that diagnostic assessment can be a critical tool for improving pedagogical practice by enhancing mathematics teaching and learning by creating groups of students, planning lesson time, focused pedagogy, giving student feedback, communicating with stakeholders, and improving teacher efficiency. Participants demonstrated satisfaction with the benefits offered by diagnostic assessment for improving mathematics teaching and learning.

With a focus on asynchronous courses, it explores innovative strategies to infuse a humanistic approach into the teaching and learning of mathematics online. The chapter is grounded in the perspective that mathematics, often perceived as an abstract discipline, can be made more relatable and engaging through techniques that emphasize human connection and interaction. Central to the discussion are practical strategies aimed at fostering a humanizing experience in online mathematics courses. These strategies include promoting peer interaction through collaborative projects and virtual study groups, effective utilization of discussion forums for meaningful exchanges, and designing activities that encourage students to share their insights and experiences. Further, the chapter discusses how educators can actively engage with students, provide timely feedback, and build supportive relationships, thereby enhancing the sense of community and motivation in the digital classroom.',\n",

       "   \"Cu-based catalysts hold promise for electrifying CO2 to produce methane, an extensively used fuel. However, the activity and selectivity remain insufficient due to the lack of catalyst design principles to steer complex CO2 reduction pathways. Herein, we develop a concept to design carbon-supported Cu catalysts by regulating Cu active sites' atomic-scale structures and engineering the carbon support's mesoscale architecture. This aims to provide a favorable local reaction microenvironment for a selective CO2 reduction pathway to methane. In situ X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy analyses reveal the dynamic reconstruction of nitrogen and hydroxyl-immobilized Cu3 (N,OH-Cu3) clusters derived from atomically dispersed Cu–N3 sites under realistic CO2 reduction conditions. The N,OH-Cu3 sites possess moderate *CO adsorption affinity and a low barrier for *CO hydrogenation, enabling intrinsically selective CO2-to-CH4 reduction compared to the C–C coupling with a high energy barrier. Importantly, a block copolymer-derived carbon fiber support with interconnected mesopores is constructed. The unique long-range mesochannels offer an H2O-deficient microenvironment and prolong the transport path for the CO intermediate, which could suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction and favor deep CO2 reduction toward methane formation. Thus, the newly developed catalyst consisting of in situ constructed N,OH-Cu3 active sites embedded into bicontinuous carbon mesochannels achieved an unprecedented Faradaic efficiency of 74.2% for the CO2 reduction to methane at an industry-level current density of 300 mA cm–2. This work explores effective concepts for steering desirable reaction pathways in complex interfacial catalytic systems via modulating active site structures at the atomic level and engineering pore architectures of supports on the mesoscale to create favorable microenvironments.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Research on high‐efficiency and cost‐efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is still a vital but challenging issue for commercializing metal–air batteries. Herein, a single‐molecule/atom hybrid catalyst is developed to boost the ORR, in which iron phthalocyanine molecules containing molecular Fe─N 4 moieties couple with atomic Co─N 4 sites on the surface of polyhedral carbon. Density functional theory calculations reveal that face‐to‐face laminated construction of Fe─N 4 and Co─N 4 in the hybrid catalyst can effectively modulate the electronic structure of active iron atoms and reduce the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step for ORR. As a result, this hybrid catalyst demonstrates excellent ORR performance, featuring a half‐wave potential of 0.904 V, a peak power density of 238.3 mW cm −2 for zinc–air battery, and outstanding electrocatalytic stability. This work offers a distinctive and robust molecular/atomic engineering approach to creating efficient electrocatalysts, advancing the fields of metal–air batteries.',\n",

       "   'Ammonia reforming of light alkane is conventionally employed for HCN production where coproduct H2 is burned for heating owing to the high reaction temperature (1200 °C) of such a highly endothermic process. Here, we show that a Ni3Ga1 intermetallic compound (IMC) catalyst is highly efficient for such a reaction, realizing efficient conversion of C1–C3 alkanes at 575–750 °C. This makes it feasible for on-purpose COx-free H2 production assuming that ammonia, as an H2 carrier, is ubiquitously available from renewable energy. At 650 °C and an alkane/ammonia ratio of 1/2, ethane and propane conversion of ∼20% and methane conversion of 13% were obtained (with nearly 100% HCN selectivity for methane and ethane) over the unsupported Ni3Ga1 IMC, which also shows high stability due to the absence of coke deposition. This breakthrough is achieved by employing a stoichiometric Ni3Ga1 mixed oxalate solid solution as the precursor for the Ni3Ga1 IMC.',\n",

       "   'Investigating the structural variation of single-atom catalysts (SACs) is crucial to reveal the reaction mechanism under working conditions. Different in situ techniques, especially X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), have been reported to study the structural changes in active sites. However, a systematic study of the relationship between the coordination environment and the catalytic ability of different kinds of SACs is still lacking. Herein, we established isolated transition metal atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) on N-doped carbon (M–N–C) and employed them in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Significantly, Ni–N–C exhibits the highest selectivity (∼97.9%) toward CO at −0.8 V vs RHE. In situ XAS characterization discloses the coordination number dependent catalytic performance. The decreased average coordination number of Ni in Ni–N–C at the voltage point with maximum Faradaic efficiency was observed. Density functional theory further provides the possible mechanism of CO2-to-CO over the undercoordinated Ni–N–C structure.',\n",

       "   \"Aqueous electrolytes are promising in large-scale energy storage applications due to intrinsic low toxicity, non-flammability, high ion conductivity, and low cost. However, pure water's narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) limits the energy density of aqueous rechargeable batteries. Water-in-salt electrolytes (WiSE) proposal has expanded the ESW to over 3 V by changing electrolyte solvation structure. The limited solubility and WIS electrolyte crystallization have been persistent concerns for imide-based lithium salts. Asymmetric lithium salts compensate for the above flaws. However, studying the solvation structure of asymmetric salt aqueous electrolytes is rare. Here, we applied small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and Raman spectroscope to reveal the solvation structure of imide-based asymmetric lithium salts.

       "   'In this article, the authors draw on the literatures about academic career pipelines and the sociology of ideas to understand how an outside group of organizations provides resources to aspiring scholars as young as high schoolers and as senior as emeriti professors. One of the goals of these organizations is to promote libertarian ideas in the academy. The authors show how, in contrast to other academic pipeline building, libertarian-leaning organizations fear that their perspectives encounter resistance in the progressive field of higher education. Therefore, to keep libertarian ideas alive, they pursue strategies to guarantee a supply of graduate students for eventual academic jobs and provide professors with relatively easy access to funding, granting them autonomy vis-à-vis their home institutions. This funding may be used in part for programs that specifically hire libertarian PhDs, which in turn provide young scholars with a step ladder into the academy. The authors call this set of strategies an “idea pipeline.” On the whole, these efforts are designed to make a career studying libertarian ideas more desirable and viable for those inclined toward these viewpoints and to ward off the demise of libertarian thought in the academy.'],\n",

Kenya's county governments have been adopting different digital platforms in compliance with the constitutional mandate of ensuring residents are well‐informed and involved in local decision‐making. However, empirical studies assessing the efficacy of social media, especially in the African context, are lacking. This study examines the extent to which social media is promoting engaged budgeting in Kenyan counties. Trained citizens in 34 counties evaluate the effectiveness of social media platforms in (1) recruiting residents to budget deliberation forums, (2) accessing county budget proposals and decisions, (3) discussing county proposals and decisions, and (4) encouraging residents to actively participate in budget deliberations with the government. Results indicate that respondents generally see social media as effective in these roles. However, village‐level budget champions are more skeptical of these social media roles in county budgeting than area‐level facilitators.\",\n",

Too often, however, these communities fail to engage each other, instead choosing to operate independently. The result is that the research being conducted fails to address the questions of the day and our governments’ challenges. In this article, we come together as a community of academics and practitioners to establish an agenda for where future research should be conducted. This agenda aims to align the research being undertaken within the academic community with the needs of those working in the community of practice. After establishing ten areas where research is needed, we followed a ranked-choice voting process to establish a prioritization for them. Based on the outcome of this process, the two primary areas where research is currently needed most are the fiscal health of our governments and the implementation of social equity budgeting.',\n",
       "   \"After analysing 40 years of census data on U.S. local government change, this study finds that the dissolution of special districts (specialised governments) or 'exits' in U.S. counties are largely unrelated to demand factors. Using fixed effects regression specified at the urban county level, we find that restrictions on the fiscal autonomy of cities are associated with decreases in the special district exit rate and count. There is also evidence that state grants of 'broad' or 'limited' functional home rule to cities increase special district dissolutions. These results largely disappear when examining subgroups of districts classified by their asset specificity. The findings are consistent with the circumvention argument made in the local autonomy literature and may indicate some service consolidation, albeit from a different perspective.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract Rapid innovations in media technologies have ushered in diverse entertainment avenues, including politically oriented content, presenting both novel opportunities and societal challenges. This study delves into the implications of the burgeoning deepfake phenomenon, particularly focusing on audience interpretation and engagement with deepfake parodies, a quintessential example of “misinfotainment.” Additionally, it examines the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) disclaimers on audience understanding and related consequences. To probe this, two experiments (N = 2,808) were executed featuring parodied politicians adopting opposing viewpoints on the issue of climate change. U.S. participants were either exposed to deepfake videos prefaced with AI disclaimers or without. Results indicate that the inclusion of an AI disclaimer significantly influenced audience comprehension and their ability to recognize the parody. These factors were subsequently associated with enjoyment, discounting, and counterarguing, which in turn showed different relationships with policy support and sharing intentions. This article culminates with insights into the theoretical underpinnings and practical ramifications of these findings.',\n",
       "   'Abstract This study investigates how U.S. Fortune 500 corporate social advocacy (CSA) discourse on multiple contentious issues is associated with public attention on Twitter/X. Our theoretical framework elucidates three discourse types and conceptualizes the diversity, structure, and stability of discourse coalition networks. Utilizing computational methods and dynamic network analysis of 43,791 corporate tweets over two years, findings reveal a prevalent use of aspirational communication in addressing climate change and healthcare disparities. Functional discourse is predominantly employed in tweets on racial equality and COVID-19 vaccination, while localization discourse is concentrated in tweets about gender/sexuality. Network analysis shows that discourse coalitions exist across industries, with a convergence in discourse types and low temporal stability in network compositions. Most discourse types and features of discourse coalition networks are positively associated with public attention to CSA tweets, though these associations vary across different issues.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract One approach to look at student learning is to identify \"threshold concepts\". These are concepts that, once grasped, allow students to engage with the material in a fundamentally different way. First described by Meyer and Land, these concepts are transformative, irreversible, integrative, and troublesome. The process of mastering a threshold concept means traversing a liminal space during which the student is changed. Using data from periodic nationwide capstone surveys, combined with observation and review of capstone design literature, we propose three threshold concepts that are typical of Capstone Design courses: (1) Complex engineering problems are best solved by teams working together. (2) A team can learn a lot from a prototype, even (especially?) when it doesn\\'t work. (3) The goal isn\\'t to find the right answer, but to learn a process by which a satisfactory answer can be found. During Fall 2022, students in a large multidisciplinary engineering capstone program were asked to complete periodic written reflections in support of concepts 1 and 2. Four times over the semester, students reflected on their individual project work as part of a team, and two to three times over the semester, teams reflected on what they learned from early-stage prototypes. This paper presents our rationale for identifying these three threshold concepts, shares preliminary observations of student growth demonstrated in reflection assignments, and proposes next steps for facilitating student progress through these thresholds.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract Ability to effectively work in teams is one of the desired outcomes of engineering and engineering technology programs. Unfortunately, working in teams is still challenging for many students. Rather than contributing to team projects, some students resort to social loafing. Social loafing tends to destroy both teamwork performance and individual learning, especially in solving ill-structured problems, such as design. Furthermore, a bad experience on a past team is a significant concern as it could generate negative feelings toward future team projects. Formation of collaborative teams is a critical first step in team-project-based design courses as team composition directly affects not only teamwork processes and outcomes, but also teamwork skills and experience. This NSF-IUSE sponsored project aims to enhance students' teamwork experiences and teamwork learning through 1) understanding how to form better student design teams and 2) identifying exercises that will effectively improve team member collaboration. We do this by comparing student characteristics and design task characteristics with the quality of the design team outcome, and examining the resulting correlations. Student characteristics cover six categories: 1) background information, 2) work structure preferences, 3) personality, 4) ability, 5) motivation, and 6) attitude. Task characteristics and design team outcomes are characterized using the Creative Product Semantic Scale. In this article, we present correlations between student/team characteristics and design project outcome, and correlations between task characteristics and design project outcome for 2020-2021 senior design teams at two institutions. For both institutions, we will present correlations between individual student characteristics and team outcome. For one institution, we will also present correlation between team-level characteristics and team outcomes.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Team building activities are popular interventions during early stages of team development. At [university], in the multidisciplinary capstone course with an average cohort size of around 350, the students on a particular capstone project team may not be mutually acquainted and thus may benefit from such team building activities. Prior literature has studied the effectiveness of various instructor-directed team building activities on student teams. However, our students are generally eager to spend class time working on their projects and often see in-class activities as a distraction rather than an important part of their growth. Instead, the student teams are now allowed to choose an intervention based on team consensus. In this paper, the relationship between attributes of the chosen intervention and student performance, as measured using a series of AACU VALUE rubrics, was studied using statistical measures. The analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of type of team building activity on teamwork, oral communication, and design & problem solving scores of individual students on the team. Also, a statistically significant effect of location of team building activity (on or off campus) on design & problem solving score was observed.'],\n",

       "   'Importance For patients with non–small cell lung cancer whose disease progressed while receiving EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy, particularly third-generation TKIs, optimal treatment options remain limited. Objective To compare the efficacy of ivonescimab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone for patients with relapsed advanced or metastatic non–small cell lung cancer with the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) variant. Design, Setting, and Participants Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 3 trial at 55 sites in China enrolled participants from January 2022 to November 2022; a total of 322 eligible patients were enrolled. Interventions Participants received ivonescimab (n = 161) or placebo (n = 161) plus pemetrexed and carboplatin once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy of ivonescimab plus pemetrexed or placebo plus pemetrexed. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population assessed by an independent radiographic review committee (IRRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. The results of the first planned interim analysis are reported. Results Among 322 enrolled patients in the ivonescimab and placebo groups, the median age was 59.6 vs 59.4 years and 52.2% vs 50.9% of patients were female. As of March 10, 2023, median follow-up time was 7.89 months. Median progression-free survival was 7.1 (95% CI, 5.9-8.7) months in the ivonescimab group vs 4.8 (95% CI, 4.2-5.6) months for placebo (difference, 2.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.46 [95% CI, 0.34-0.62]; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). The prespecified subgroup analysis showed progression-free survival benefit favoring patients receiving ivonescimab over placebo across almost all subgroups, including patients whose disease progressed while receiving third-generation EGFR-TKI therapy (HR, 0.48 [95% CI 0.35-0.66]) and those with brain metastases (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.22-0.73]). The objective response rate was 50.6% (95% CI, 42.6%-58.6%) with ivonescimab and 35.4% (95% CI, 28.0%-43.3%) with placebo (difference, 15.6% [95% CI, 5.3%-26.0%]; P = .006). The median overall survival data were not mature; at data cutoff, 69 patients (21.4%) had died. Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 99 patients (61.5%) in the ivonescimab group vs 79 patients (49.1%) in the placebo group, the most common of which were chemotherapy-related. Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 patients (6.2%) in the ivonescimab group vs 4 (2.5%) in the placebo group. Grade 3 or higher vascular endothelial growth factor–related adverse events occurred in 5 patients (3.1%) in the ivonescimab group vs 4 (2.5%) in the placebo group. Conclusions Ivonescimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival with tolerable safety profile in TKI-treated non–small cell lung cancer.

       "   'Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of PCSK9 monoclonal antibody(mAb) specifically for Chinese patients have been limited. This multi-center RCT is to clarify the efficacy and safety of a novel mAb, Ebronucimab, in Chinese patients. Patients diagnosed with primary hypercholesterolemia, including Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia, or mixed dyslipidemia, were categorized by ASCVD risk and randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:1:2:1 to receive Ebronucimab 450 mg or matching placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W), or Ebronucimab 150 mg or matching placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W). The primary outcome was the percentage change of LDL-C from baseline to week 12 for all groups. The least squares mean reduction difference (95 %CI) in LDL-C from baseline to week 12 of Ebronucimab 450 mg Q4W and Ebronucimab 150 mg Q2W groups versus the placebo group was -59.13 (-64.103, -54.153) (Adjusted p<0.0001) and -60.43 (-65.450, -55.416) (Adjusted p<0.0001), respectively. Meanwhile, the Ebronucimab group exhibited notably high rates in reaching LDL-C goals of each cardiovascular risk stratification. In addition, Ebronucimab effectively improved other lipid panel. During the double-blind treatment period, relatively frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were injection site reactions (ISR), urinary tract infection, and hyperuricemia (Incidence rate are 6.9 %, 4.8 % and 3.5 %). Among treatment-associated AEs, only injection site reactions (ISR) occurred more in the dose groups. In conclusion, Ebronucimab, with either 450 mg Q4W or 150 mg Q2W doses, demonstrated significant efficacy in lowering serum LDL-C level with a favorable safety and immunogenicity profile among hypercholesterolemic patients.',\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Purpose This study builds on the practice-based view of strategy to examine whether the three most commonly prescribed strategic planning best practices – scanning, communication openness and participative decision-making – actually strengthen the planning-performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach The study uses objective performance data and data from a survey of 159 managers from 43 publicly listed US firms to test the hypothesized moderation effects of best practices. The analysis uses hierarchical regression. Findings At high levels of planning, firms high in participative decision-making and low in openness and scanning outperform firms low in participation and high in openness and scanning. The results reverse at low levels of planning. Research limitations/implications This is a cross-sectional study with a small sample. The response rate was modest; hence, the results should be treated as exploratory. Since the sample is not random, the results may not be generalizable. Practical implications While managers may find a best practice label helpful, the best practices implemented within a firm need to fit existing planning processes in order to increase planning effectiveness. Originality/value While academic scholarship sometimes struggles with generating actionable prescriptions for improving strategic planning, recommendations by practitioners lack empirical backing. This study builds on the practice-based view of strategy to bridge this gap. These results are consistent with both academic and practitioner literature on strategic planning in finding that the best practices of scanning, openness and participative decision-making strengthen the planning-performance relationship at different planning levels, possibly by underpinning the firm’s dynamic capabilities.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Marine SAR116 bacterioplankton are ubiquitous in surface waters across global oceans and form their own order, Puniceispirillales, within the Alphaproteobacteria. To date no comparative physiology among diverse SAR116 isolates has been performed to capture the functional diversity within the clade, and further, diversity through the lens of metabolic potential and environmental preferences via clade-wide pangenomics remains poorly constrained. Using high-throughput dilution-to-extinction cultivation, we isolated and genome sequenced five new and diverse SAR116 isolates from the northern Gulf of Mexico. Here we present a comparative physiological analysis of these SAR116 isolates, along with a pangenomic investigation of the SAR116 clade using a combination of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs, n=258), single-amplified genomes (SAGs, n=84), previously existing (n=2), and new isolate genomes (n=5), totaling 349 SAR116 genomes. Phylogenomic investigation supported the division of SAR116 into three distinct subclades, each with additional structure totalling 15 monophyletic groups. Our SAR116 isolates belonged to three groups within subclade I representing distinct genera with different morphologies and varied phenotypic responses to salinity and temperature. Overall, SAR116 genomes encoded differences in vitamin and amino acid synthesis, trace metal transport, and osmolyte synthesis and transport. They also had genetic potential for diverse sulfur oxidation metabolisms, placing SAR116 at the confluence of the organic and inorganic sulfur pools. SAR116 subclades showed distinct patterns in habitat preferences across open ocean, coastal, and estuarine environments, and three of our isolates represented the most abundant coastal and estuarine subclade. This investigation provides the most comprehensive exploration of SAR116 to date anchored by new culture genomes and physiology.',\n",
       "   'Abstract The evolutionary trajectory of Methylophilaceae includes habitat transitions from freshwater sediments to freshwater and marine pelagial that resulted in genome reduction (genome-streamlining) of the pelagic taxa. However, the extent of genetic similarities in the genomic structure and microdiversity of the two genome-streamlined pelagic lineages (freshwater “Ca. Methylopumilus” and the marine OM43 lineage) has so far never been compared. Here, we analyzed complete genomes of 91 “Ca. Methylopumilus” strains isolated from 14 lakes in Central Europe and 12 coastal marine OM43 strains. The two lineages showed a remarkable niche differentiation with clear species-specific differences in habitat preference and seasonal distribution. On the other hand, we observed a synteny preservation in their genomes by having similar locations and types of flexible genomic islands (fGIs). Three main fGIs were identified: a replacement fGI acting as phage defense, an additive fGI harboring metabolic and resistance-related functions, and a tycheposon containing nitrogen-, thiamine-, and heme-related functions. The fGIs differed in relative abundances in metagenomic datasets suggesting different levels of variability ranging from strain-specific to population-level adaptations. Moreover, variations in one gene seemed to be responsible for different growth at low substrate concentrations and a potential biogeographic separation within one species. Our study provides a first insight into genomic microdiversity of closely related taxa within the family Methylophilaceae and revealed remarkably similar dynamics involving mobile genetic elements and recombination between freshwater and marine family members.',\n",
       "   'Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are of high economic and ecological importance, owing to their diverse communities and the disproportionate role they play in carbon cycling, particularly in carbon sequestration. Organisms inhabiting these environments must overcome strong natural fluctuations in salinity, nutrients, and turbidity, as well as numerous climate change-induced disturbances such as land loss, sea level rise, and, in some locations, increasingly severe tropical cyclones that threaten to disrupt future ecosystem health. The northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) along the Louisiana coast contains dozens of estuaries, including the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River outflow, which dramatically influence the region due to their vast upstream watershed. Nevertheless, the microbiology of these estuaries and surrounding coastal environments has received little attention. To improve our understanding of microbial ecology in the understudied coastal nGoM, we conducted a 16S rRNA gene amplicon survey at eight sites and multiple time points along the Louisiana coast and one inland swamp spanning freshwater to high brackish salinities, totaling 47 duplicated Sterivex (0.2-2.7 µm) and prefilter (>2.7 µm) samples. We cataloged over 13,000 Amplicon Sequence ariants (ASVs) from common freshwater and marine clades such as SAR11 (Alphaproteobacteria),',\n",
       "   'Background Echinoderms play crucial roles in coral reef ecosystems, where they are significant detritivores and herbivores. The phylum is widely known for its boom and bust cycles, driven by food availability, predation pressure and mass mortalities. Hence, surveillance of potential pathogens and associates of grossly normal specimens is important to understanding their roles in ecology and mass mortality. Methods We performed viral surveillance in two common coral reef echinoderms, Diadema antillarum and Holothuria floridana , using metagenomics. Urchin specimens were obtained during the 2022 Diadema antillarum scuticociliatosis mass mortality event from the Caribbean and grossly normal H. floridana specimens from a reef in Florida. Viral metagenomes were assembled and aligned against viral genomes and protein encoding regions. Metagenomic reads and previously sequenced transcriptomes were further investigated for putative viral elements by Kraken2. Results D. antillarum was devoid of viruses typically seen in echinoderms, but H. floridana yielded viral taxa similar to those found in other sea cucumbers, including Pisoniviricetes (Picornaviruses), Ellioviricetes (Bunyaviruses), and Magsaviricetes (Nodaviruses). The lack of viruses detected in D. antillarum may be due to the large amount of host DNA in viral metagenomes, or because viruses are less abundant in D. antillarum tissues when compared to H. floridana tissues. Our results also suggest that RNA amplification approach may influence viral representation in viral metagenomes. While our survey was successful in describing viruses associated with both echinoderms, our results indicate that viruses are less pronounced in D. antillarum than in other echinoderms. These results are important in context of wider investigation on the association between viruses and D. antillarum mass mortalities, since the conventional method used in this study was unsuccessful.',\n",

       "   'Biostimulating native microbes with fertilizers has proven to be a highly effective strategy to speed up biodegradation rates in microbial communities. This study investigates the genetic potential of microbes to degrade light synthetic crude oil in a freshwater coastal wetland. Experimental sediment microcosms were exposed to a variety of conditions (biological control, a light synthetic crude oil amendment, and light synthetic crude oil with nutrient amendment) and incubated for 30 days before volatile organic compounds (BTEX) were quantified and DNA was sequenced for metagenomic analysis. The resulting DNA sequences were binned into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Analyses of MAGs uncovered a 13-fold significant increase in the abundance of rate-limiting hydrocarbon degrading monooxygenases and dioxygenases, identified only in MAGs from the light synthetic crude oil with nutrient amendments. Further, complete degradation pathways for BTEX compounds were found only in MAGs resulting from the light synthetic crude with nutrient amendment. Moreover, volatile organic compounds (BTEX, cyclohexane, and naphthalene) analyses of microcosm sediments in the presence of nutrients documented that benzene was degraded below detection limits, toluene (98%) and ethylbenzene (67%) were predominantly reduced within 30 days. Results indicate that the genetic potential to degrade BTEX compounds in this freshwater wetland can be linked to the functional potential for bioremediation. BTEX compounds are typically more recalcitrant and tougher to degrade than alkanes. This study demonstrated that stimulating a microbial community with nutrients to enhance its ability to biodegrade hydrocarbons, even in a relatively nutrient-rich habitat like a freshwater wetland, is an effective remediation tactic. The impact of oil spills in a freshwater aquatic environment can pose dire social, economic, and ecological effects on the region. An oil spill in the Laurentian Great Lakes region has the potential to affect the drinking water of more than 30 million people. The light synthetic crude oil used in this experimental microcosm study is transported through an underground pipeline crossing the waterway between two Laurentian Great Lakes. This study collected metagenomic data (experiments in triplicate) and assessed the quantity of BTEX compounds, which connected microbial degradation function to gene potential. The resulting data documented the bioremediation capabilities of native microbes in a freshwater coastal wetland. This study also provided evidence for this region that bioremediation can be a viable remediation strategy instead of invasive physical methods.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract How do cultural biases, trust in government, and perceptions of risk and protective actions influence compliance with regulation of COVID-19? Analyzing Chinese ( n = 646) and American public opinion samples ( n = 1,325) from spring 2020, we use Grid–Group Cultural Theory and the Protective Action Decision Model to specify, respectively, cultural influences on public risk perceptions and decision-making regarding protective actions. We find that cultural biases mostly affect protective actions indirectly through public perceptions. Regardless of country, hierarchical cultural biases increase protective behaviors via positive perceptions of protective actions. However, other indirect effects of cultural bias via public perceptions vary across both protective actions and countries. Moreover, trust in government only mediates the effect of cultural bias in China and risk perception only mediates the effect of cultural bias in the United States. Our findings suggest that regulators in both countries should craft regulations that are congenial to culturally diverse populations.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract We provide the first account of the culture wars in the political psychology and public opinion literature based on a theory of culture. Using innovative measures of grid‐group cultural theory (CT), we identify the cultures associated with ideological and partisan identifications in annual U.S. national surveys from 2011 to 2022, a unique data set of 24,870 respondents. As hypothesized, we find that the culture wars occur not just between ideologues and partisans but among them as they draw support from distinct, relatively stable yet shifting cultural coalitions. Egalitarian and, less often, fatalistic liberals and Democrats battle against individualistic and, less often, hierarchical, conservatives and Republicans. As hypothesized, fatalists are the least reliable coalition partners, and, as expected, they gravitate Republican and conservative in 2017, after Trump's election. However, fatalists who are strong partisan identifiers never defect. Moreover, our hypothesis that fatalist attraction to Trump would drive defections in their political identification is largely invalidated. Instead, fatalists mostly flee Trump in our aggregate analysis as well as in subanalyses of strong and weak ideological and partisan identifiers. In 2016 and 2018–2022, it appears that independent fatalists cause fatalists to gravitate liberal and Democrat. Unexpectedly, hierarchists also go liberal and Democrat in 2022, in apparent reaction to Trump's multifront attacks on the 2020 election that he lost. We identify the basis for cultural coalitions that can end particular culture wars, including the most significant one now occurring between egalitarians and individualists, and conclude with suggestions for further research.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Objective Efforts to measure cultural identities in survey research rely on self‐reported ethnic, racial, and national identities. We test how survey operationalization of grid–group cultural theory (CT) influences the classification of individuals’ (sub)cultural identities. Methods A national online sample of Americans ( n = 697 for current analyses) rated items from CT indices, CT statements, and cultural cognition theory (CCT) indices in a 2016–2017 panel survey. Individuals were classified as identifying with a culture if they supported it (e.g., rating it above the scale mean or median, or in the top 35 percent of the scale distribution) or agreed with each item constituting the scale (the “midpoint method” introduced here). Results Different classification methods and cultural measures yield different proportions of support of cultural biases, yielding statistically significant differences despite most people being similarly classified. Survey measures can unequivocally assign a minority of people to a single cultural identity, with a majority so classified only if one does not require the individual to support only one bias. Conclusions Using a short, conceptually valid measure of culture with the novel midpoint method seems best for CT survey researchers but should have implications more broadly in cultural identity research and social science efforts to classify individuals.'],\n",

Some informal caregivers participate in web-based forums related to their caregiving role. This study aimed to explore how informal caregivers use easy-to-access caregiving web-based forums, including the types of information they share and seek from others. It also aimed to gain insights into the informal caregiver experience from the content these informal caregivers posted. The study population consisted of participants who posted on 5 web-based forums for informal caregivers between February and April 2024. Researchers extracted the first 6 responses to the first 20 questions and comments to appear posted by the informal caregivers in each of the 5 forums, removing any individually identifying information. We used a codebook thematic analysis approach to examine the data with Dedoose (SocioCultural Research Consultants). Researchers independently read all posts and coded the data. The author group discussed the codes, reiteratively refined them, and identified themes within the data. The data consisted of 100 initial posts and 600 responses. Over half of the initial posts included specific questions, with the remaining initial posts sharing experiences or reflections. Posts ranged in length from a sentence to more than 500 words. Domains identified included handling interpersonal challenges, navigating complicated systems, gathering tactical coping strategies, managing emotions, and connecting with others in similar situations. Negative interpersonal interactions were mentioned 123 times, with 77 posts describing challenging situations with extended family. Posters inquired about accessing resources, with health care and health insurance included 51 times, while legal and financial concerns were addressed 124 times. Caregiving challenges were mentioned hundreds of times, including discussion of hygiene (n=18), nutrition (n=21), and desire for a caregiving break (n=47). Posters expressed emotion in their comments 180 times, which included 32 mentions of guilt and 26 mentions of positive emotion. The importance of web-based group support was mentioned 301 times. Informal caregivers play an essential role in society. Many experience multifaceted challenges related to their caregiving role, and some turn to the internet for community. Accessing web-based discussion forums is a low-barrier method for informal caregivers to connect with others who may be experiencing similar emotions and challenges. Gaining a greater understanding of the ways informal caregivers seek advice and offer support to one another provides insight into the challenges they face. The domains identified on these forums may be helpful, as clinicians provide information to care recipients and their informal caregivers along their health journeys.',\n",
       "   \"A breast cancer diagnosis can impact every aspect of a woman's life, particularly for women diagnosed before age 45 when they are in the process of establishing stability in their personal and professional lives. This study investigated the impact of a breast cancer diagnosis on employment, finances, and personal relationships among young breast cancer survivors. We conducted descriptive statistical analysis of survey data from 315 women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45. Surveys were administered electronically and included 40 questions on demographics asking about employment, insurance, income, and marital status at two time points: at diagnosis and at the time the survey was completed. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted. The McNemar-Bowker Test of Symmetry was used to calculate the significance of changes in employment, insurance, income, and marital status at the two time points. We found significant changes following diagnosis in employment and insurance. Prior to diagnosis, 68.6% of respondents were employed full time, compared to 52.4% following diagnosis – falling from 212 to 162 respondents. Individuals who were unable to work increased by 14.6% after diagnosis, rising from 4 to 49 respondents. The decline in full-time employment was highest among those with a diagnosis of Stage IV cancer (33.9%), with the number of full-time worker respondents falling from 79 to 41. We found a significant change in insurance (p < .001) with a decline in individuals with private or no insurance of 4.7% and 3.4%, respectively, while those with public insurance increased by 8.1%. Our findings suggest that young breast cancer survivors are particularly vulnerable to changes in employment, with more than a tenfold increase in the number of young women who reported being unable to work following diagnosis. Our findings also indicate a significant shift from private to public insurance, particularly for individuals living with Stage IV cancer. These results point to opportunities to address the specific needs of young women diagnosed with breast cancer and improve their overall quality of life.\",\n",
       "   \"The Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pregnancy Care recommend that during the first and subsequent antenatal visits all pregnant women are weighed; advised of recommended gestational weight gain (GWG), dietary intake and physical activity; and offered referrals for additional support if needed.

       "   'Abstract Introduction E‐cigarette use has rapidly increased amongst young people in Australia, however the prevalence of use amongst pregnant people is not known. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of e‐cigarette use and dual use of e‐cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes, characteristics associated with use and reasons for use amongst a sample of pregnant Australian people attending public antenatal clinics. Methods A cross‐sectional survey was conducted with 4024 pregnant people attending antenatal appointments, between July 2021 and December 2022, in one local health district in New South Wales, Australia. Main outcome measures were current use of e‐cigarettes, dual use with tobacco cigarettes, participant characteristics associated with use and reasons for use. Results 1.24% of pregnant people used e‐cigarettes, 34% of these were dual smokers. Being a current smoker (OR 39.49; 95% CI 9.99–156.21) or ex‐smoker (OR 29.86; 95% CI 8.75–101.95) were associated with e‐cigarette use. Quitting smoking was the most reported reason for use (52%). Discussion and Conclusions This study is the first to report on the prevalence of e‐cigarette use amongst pregnant people in Australia. We found that a small proportion of pregnant people use e‐cigarettes and that many are dual users or ex‐smokers. E‐cigarette use and rates of dual use in pregnancy in Australia appear lower than internationally, however they are similarly being used as a smoking‐cessation aid by many. As regulatory environments relating to e‐cigarette access change in Australia, large‐scale studies are required to continue to monitor e‐cigarette use and dual use in pregnancy.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Background: Implementation of recommended gestational weight gain (GWG) care by antenatal care providers is poor. It is unclear whether practice implementation and barriers Tadiffer between antenatal care provider profession or experience. This study aimed to assesses the provision of and barriers to guideline care for GWG and examine associations with professional discipline and years of experience. Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted with antenatal care providers working in three public maternity services in a regional city in Australia. Data were collected on the provision of and barriers (informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework) to recommended GWG care. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics. Associations between health profession characteristics (professional discipline and years providing antenatal care) and GWG care practices and barrier outcomes were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: 117 antenatal care providers completed the survey (75% participation rate). One quarter (25%) reported that they routinely provided recommended GWG assessment at the first antenatal visit, and 9% at subsequent visits. Only 7% routinely provided recommended advice on GWG, healthy eating and physical activity. Professional discipline or years of experience were not associated with higher odds of GWG practices. Skills, belief about capabilities, belief about consequences and environmental context and resources were barriers to providing care. Medical professionals had higher odds of agreeing that they have been adequately trained to address GWG (OR = 9.14, 95%CI:3.10-26.90) and feel competent in having sensitive conversations with pregnant women about GWG (OR = 8.60, 95%CI:2.29-32.28) than midwives. Midwives had higher odds of agreeing that there are services they can refer pregnant women to for further support (OR = 2.80, 95%CI:1.13-6.91). Conclusions: The provision of antenatal care for GWG was low, inconsistently provided and did not differ by professional discipline or years of experience. Antenatal care providers report numerous barriers including skills, belief about capabilities, belief about consequences, and environmental context and resources. Barriers to GWG care provision differed by professional discipline, but not years of providing care. The findings demonstrate that the type and prioritisation of practice-change implementation strategies may need to be tailored to address the differential barriers faced by professional groups.',\n",
       "   'Introduction Globally, guideline-recommended antenatal care for smoking cessation is not routinely delivered by antenatal care providers. Implementation strategies have been shown to improve the delivery of clinical practices across a variety of clinical services but there is an absence of evidence in applying such strategies to support improvements to antenatal care for smoking cessation in pregnancy. This study aims to determine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of implementation strategies in increasing the routine provision of recommended antenatal care for smoking cessation in public maternity services. Methods and analysis A non-randomised stepped-wedge cluster-controlled trial will be conducted in maternity services across three health sectors in New South Wales, Australia. Implementation strategies including guidelines and procedures, reminders and prompts, leadership support, champions, training and monitoring and feedback will be delivered sequentially to each sector over 4 months. Primary outcome measures will be the proportion of: (1) pregnant women who report receiving a carbon monoxide breath test; (2) smokers or recent quitters who report receiving quit/relapse advice; and (3) smokers who report offer of help to quit smoking (Quitline referral or nicotine replacement therapy). Outcomes will be measured via cross-sectional telephone surveys with a random sample of women who attend antenatal appointments each week. Economic analyses will be undertaken to assess the cost effectiveness of the implementation intervention. Process measures including acceptability, adoption, fidelity and reach will be reported. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained through the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (16/11/16/4.07; 16/10/19/5.15) and the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council (1236/16). Trial findings will be disseminated to health policy-makers and health services to inform best practice processes for effective guideline implementation. Findings will also be disseminated at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry—ACTRN12622001010785.',\n",

We have developed a novel nanoporous organosilicate (NPO) film as an extraction phase and proof of concept for application in adsorbing hydrophobic compounds in water and sediment. We characterized the NPO film properties and provided optimization for synthesis and coatings in order to apply the technology in environmental media. NPO films in this study had a very high surface area, up to 1325 m2/g due to the high level of mesoporosity in the film. The potential application of the NPO film as a sorbent phase for sensors or passive samplers was evaluated using a model hydrophobic chemical, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), in water and sediment. Sorption of PCB to this porous high surface area nanoparticle platform was highly correlated with the bioavailable fraction of PCB measured using whole sediment chemistry, porewater chemistry determined by solid-phase microextraction fiber methods, and the Lumbriculus variegatus bioaccumulation bioassay. The surface-modified NPO films in this study were found to highly sorb chemicals with a log octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) greater than four; however, surface modification of these particles would be required for application to other chemicals.',\n",
       "   'Abstract This paper presents a versatile nanotransfer printing method for achieving large-area sub-micron patterns of functional materials. Organosilicate ink formulations combined with effective release layers have been shown to facilitate patterning of materials through the commonly used patterning approaches – lift off, physical etching and chemical etching. In this paper, we demonstrate that organosilicate ink formulations function as an effective resist owing to its superior physico-chemical stability whereas the release layers ensure clean removal of the resist post patterning. We successfully demonstrate patterning of sub-micron structures (800 nm feature sizes) of chromium metal through the lift off approach, silicon through reactive ion etching technique and silicon dioxide through wet chemical etching technique illustrating the versatility of the reported method. This patterning methodology represents a significant advancement in enabling nanostructure fabrication within resource-constrained laboratories. The approach requires nothing more than a master mold containing the desired structures, a spin coater, a low-temperature hotplate, and a desktop reactive ion etch tool.&amp;#xD;'],\n",

Data were gathered through administration of Fitzsimmons-Doolan’s 2011 ideology dimensions survey at the beginning of an academic semester. At the end of the term, participants answered two open-ended questions. Results document that the future teachers mediated their philosophical stances as they examined the differences between topics in their university studies and prior experiences. Four themes that concerned the future teachers emerged in the data analysis: cultural assumptions, academic and affective needs, right to plurilingualism, curricular insights. The themes indicate that preparing teachers through an identity directed lens, empowers them and builds their agency.',\n",

A total of 293 pre-service teachers completed Fitzsimmons-Doolan's 2011 language ideology dimensions survey at the beginning of an academic semester. At the end of the term candidates responded to three open-ended questions, and responses were analysed and categorised into three themes: what candidates need to know, what EBs' academic needs are, and what a culturally relevant teacher preparation curriculum must offer. Findings suggest participants' visions of schooling seemed to change after completing two or more BEM courses, and after reaching a 21–30 clinical hour scaffold working in an instructional capacity with EBs in K-12 schools.\",\n",
       "   \"The integration of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) into educational settings has gained significant attention due to its positive correlation with student academic achievement and long-term success. While extensively studied in developed nations, empirical evidence regarding SEL implementation in Latin America (LA) remains limited. Uruguay, one of the few countries in LA integrating SEL into educational curricula, aims to bolster SEL practises to improve student outcomes. However, there is prevailing concern among Uruguayan teachers regarding the need for adequate training to effectively implement SEL. This qualitative study investigates the efforts of Uruguayan English as a Foreign Language (EFL) elementary teachers to embed SEL within their instruction. Following a three-week online SEL course, 22 teachers were observed using the SEL Coaching Toolkit. Findings revealed teachers' commitment to integrate SEL, yet inconsistencies and limited explicit SEL practises were observed. The study highlights a need for enhanced SEL training and support for educators. Recommendations include providing foundational SEL knowledge, fostering collaborative learning environments, and empowering educators to effectively nurture students’ social emotional competencies, thereby advocating for equitable educational opportunities and fostering positive learning outcomes. Keywords: Social emotional learning, professional development, teacher training, SEL practises, English as a Foreign Language.\",\n",

The TAs represented the fields of political science, history, English, psychology, world languages, and kinesiology at one public university. One-on-one interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed utilizing six phase thematic analysis. Interactive analysis and coding provided a system to examine the data, generate initial codes, and subsequently review, define, and report on the themes that emerged.

A total of 32 K-5th grade English as a Foreign Language (EFL) Uruguayan teachers completed a three-week online asynchronous professional development. Participants’ training focused on SEL principles, practices, and strategies for the English as a foreign language classroom. During the training, a three-scale rubric (0 - 3 points) served to formatively assess and provide feedback to the participants on completing weekly tasks. The evaluation examined the content of the teachers’ reflection and applications to practice. Feedback focused on how well teachers grasped the theoretical content and its integration. Once the training was completed, participants answered four open-ended questions in an online repository questionnaire. Findings document that after the intervention, the teachers perceived that students benefitted from learning about SEL and its implementation, and they came to believe that SEL principles need to become an integral part of instructional planning in Uruguay’s EFL classrooms.'],\n",

Methods The search procedure reflected Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Web of Science, PsychInfo, PubMed, and Elton B. Stephens Company (EBSCO) (2004–2019) were searched for studies that aimed to change children’s (2 to 12 years old) diet (one or more eating practice components: fruit, vegetables, whole grains, lower saturated fat, lower sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), intake of dairy, diet quality). Of 2316 papers, 22 met inclusion criteria. Results Fruits ( n = 12) and vegetables ( n = 15) were the most frequent outcomes. Half of fruit-targeted, two-thirds of vegetable-targeted, half of fruit/vegetable-targeted, eight of nine SSB-targeted, and one of two whole grain-targeted outcomes showed significant improvements. The actual food intake change was modest in most cases. Eighteen interventions included parents, although the four that did not also reported significant outcomes. Most studies were conducted in schools, early childcare, or after-school programs ( n = 13) with significant improvements in most settings. Only about half of the studies involving children &lt; 10 years used proxy reporting/direct observation. Eight studies included no reliability, validity, or citation for the method of dietary measurement. Conclusion Robust studies continue to focus on one or two foods, parental involvement may be beneficial depending on the intervention, and more research is needed to establish best practices across all settings.',\n",
       "   \"Nutrition, cooking, and gardening lessons individually and together have been shown to increase fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption in school-aged children. The CATCH Rainbow program incorporated nutrition education, cooking, and gardening lessons aimed at increasing FV consumption in elementary school-aged children and assessed changes in participants' BMI, self-reported FV consumption, and skin carotenoid levels at baseline and post-intervention. Two-hundred and twenty-five 4th and 5th graders (mean age: 9.8 years and 52% male participants) at Genoa Elementary School participated in six cooking and six gardening sessions between September 2021 and May 2022. Each nutrition education session was 25 min long, paired with either hands-on cooking activities or gardening skills. At baseline and post-intervention, participants' height and weight were assessed with a stadiometer/scale, and skin carotenoid measurement was taken by a Veggie Meter® (Longevity Link Corporation (Salt Lake City, UT, USA)). Students also completed the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire to self-report FV consumption at both time points. Focus groups were conducted with children at the end of the program for qualitative feedback. paired samples T-test and regression analysis results indicate no significant decrease in BMI or significant increase in skin carotenoid scores from pre- to post-intervention. However, though not significant, there was an increase in self-reported FV intake by 0.4 servings. Additionally, the qualitative feedback was positive, as children mentioned benefits of healthy eating and expressed enjoyment for growing, cooking, and tasting fruits and vegetables. Results from this study can be used to guide future cooking and gardening programs for elementary school children. Time of the year when implementing these programs and collecting data may impact study outcomes due to seasonal variations in fruit and vegetable intake.\",\n",
       "   \"Objectives: ROADS to FACTS summer camp was designed to teach high school students about STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) careers and offered them an opportunity to develop, practice and enhance college readiness. Methods: 29 high school students participated in a 1-week residential summer camp on the campus of Northern Illinois University (NIU). University students and outreach program staff led many different camp activities focusing on food, health, engineering, and computer science. The campers also learned about the college application process, different universities to attend, and different STEM majors to pursue. Additionally, the campers experienced college life while staying overnight in the dormitories for the seven-day period. At the end of the camp, the campers filled out an evaluation survey including demographic questions, 20 Likert-scale questions assessing the camp experience, and 6 open ended questions to provide qualitative feedback about the camp. Results: Camp participants were 62% females, 31% identified as Black, and 48% identified as Hispanics. The students had a positive and rewarding experience as indicated by majority of the campers (70%) selecting agree and strongly agree for the Likert scale questions. They enjoyed learning about food science and health careers, meeting new people, participating in field trips and other interactive activities, and experiencing college/dorm life. Majority of the campers expressed interest in pursuing nutrition and health related majors in college and are planning to seek admission in in-state universities with NIU being the most popular choice (50% campers). Conclusions: ROADS to FACTS camp brought together high school students that are passionate and wanted to learn more about STEM programs. The camp allowed students to participate in engaging activities, learn about new careers, and make new connections. Some students enjoyed the program more than others but the majority of students enjoyed their experience at the camp. The constructive feedback about the camp based on participants' experience can be used to improve the program for future implementation.

Rapid ecosystem change threatens Inuit people’s food security and adds to existing generational trauma caused by ongoing colonialism and industrialization. Indigenous owned environmental monitoring programs prioritize safety, support community empowerment and self-determination to increase the understanding of and resilience to the impacts of this human caused global climate crisis. To this end, in 2019 local expert fishers and hunters from the Inuvialuit Settlement Region worked collaboratively with an independent research scientist to start up community owned aquatic monitoring and observation (AMO) programs in Sachs Harbour and Ulukhaktok in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The field teams received training to collect year-round data of lake and coastal water quality data using scientific instruments that measure water temperature, conductivity/salinity, turbidity and dissolved oxygen with depth from the surface down to 150 meters. ROV’s, drones and hydrophones extend observations and Traditional &amp; Local Knowledge (TLK) directs the programs. External clients can hire the teams to augment core funding. AMO teams are finalizing their program and data ownership protocols, which are informed by the Canadian UNDRIP Act and OCAP® principles. Indigenous owned, directed and operated environmental monitoring programs justly deserve funding priority and ongoing public support to help conserve and protect critical areas for future generations.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract It is suggested that in addition to seismicity deep fluid injection may cause surface uplift and subsidence in oil and gas‐producing regions. This study uses the Raton Basin as an example to investigate the hydromechanical processes of surface uplift and subsidence during wastewater injection. The Raton Basin, in southern central Colorado and northern central New Mexico, has experienced wastewater injection related to coalbed methane and gas production starting in 1994. In this study, we estimate the extent and magnitude of total vertical deformation in the Raton Basin from 1994 to 2020 and incremental deformation between the years 2017 to 2020. Results indicate a modeled uplift as much as 15 cm occurring between 1994 and 2020. Between 2017 and 2020, up to 3 cm of uplift occurred, largely near the northwestern injection wells. Most modeled uplift between 1994 and 2020 occurred near the southern wells, where the greatest cumulative volume of wastewater was injected. However, modeled subsidence occurred around the southern and eastern wells between 2017 and 2020, after the rate of injection decreased. Modeling indicates that while the magnitude of modeled uplift corresponds to cumulative injection volume and maximum rate in the long‐term, short‐term incremental deformation (uplift or subsidence) is controlled by changes in the rate of injection. The number of yearly earthquake events follows periods of rapid modeled uplifting throughout the Basin, suggesting that measurable surface deformation may be caused by the same injection‐induced pore pressure perturbations that initiate seismicity.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The Hutchinson Salt Member of the Wellington Formation (Permian) is preserved throughout central and south-central Kansas as a more-or-less continuous body with net thicknesses of up to 560 ft (170 m). This salt has been extensively dissolved along its eastern margin due to contact with unconfined, undersaturated ground water during the Tertiary, Quaternary, and present. West of the main dissolutional edge, localized salt solution is occurring, probably associated with subsurface ground-water flow focused along structural conduits such as fractures and faults. Such solution has occurred in the past and in some areas is presently occurring. In those areas where dissolution and associated deformation has not occurred, the Hutchinson Salt can generally be mapped on seismic data. Exceptions occur in those areas where the salt is too thin to be resolved given the effective bandwidth of the seismic data. Undeformed salt does not appreciably degrade the quality of seismic events of deeper origin. In contrast, in those areas where significant leaching has occurred, the Hutchinson Salt can be difficult to map seismically. The reflection from the top of the remnant salt can be difficult to correlate as a result of excessive curvatures and surface irregularities, lateral variations in acoustic-impedance contrast, and superposed diffractions emanating from salt-related collapse features. The intra-salt and base salt events can be masked by diffractions as well as velocity-generated time-structural relief. The recognition of velocity-generated time-structural relief along pre-salt events is particularly critical to the petroleum explorationist. It is imperative that the industry interpreter differentiate real structure from apparent structure on seismic data to preclude the possibility of drilling into non-existent structural closure along pre-salt horizons. The explorationist working in Kansas should be aware of the distribution of subsurface salts and the potential for leaching.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['This exploratory study describes the distribution of pre-service teacher (PST) technology use for formal or informal professional learning. Additionally, it describes PSTs’ self-efficacy for technology use and associated factors. Laptops and smartphones were among the most commonly used devices. Technology use for professional learning was common in general but less so for informal learning. Modest levels of PST self-efficacy varied by activity, with lower levels of self-efficacy for informal learning. PSTs were particularly stressed due to examinations, workload, and lack of time to relax. Also, PSTs’ academic stress pertaining to performance pressures and time restraints was associated with greater technology use while academic stress pertaining to workload was associated with less technology use. Limitations and future directions are discussed.',\n",
       "   \"It is well known that teacher professional development may not result in meaningful change to classroom instruction. A recent theoretical model by McChesney and Aldridge (2021) posited that this phenomenon may be explained on account of 'implementation barriers' to professional development delivery. The present study thus investigated the nature, structure, and distribution of such barriers to the impact of teacher professional development on classroom practice. Using survey data collected from three Illinois school districts (N = 274), we identified six distinct but non-orthogonal barriers (e.g. school culture, relevance, teacher resistance) and found that the most commonly perceived specific implementation barriers were time constraints and pressures, other curricular mandates or demands, and stress or burnout. Repeated-measures analysis of variance also showed some differences in the profiles of the six barriers across the school districts.\",\n",

The antibacterial activity of the compounds was evaluated against Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria, with L 3 demonstrating the most significant activity. The compounds were also evaluated for their antioxidant activity using DPPH, FRAP, and NO scavenging assays. While the compounds exhibited concentration‐dependent scavenging of free radicals, their activity was not as significant as that of the reference, Trolox. Furthermore, L 1 – L 3 were tested for their α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity, with L 1 showing the highest inhibitory activity among the three compounds. The DFT study showed that L 1 is the most chemically reactive among the three compounds, having the lowest energy band gap value of 3.82 eV in acetonitrile, the experimental solvent. Molecular docking predicted that L 1 and L 2 have very strong inhibition equivalents to the standard drugs against bacteria and diabetes. All the compounds showed stronger inhibition against α‐glucosidase than acarbose, while only L 1 and L 2 exhibited stronger inhibition against α‐amylase than acarbose. It can be deduced that the theoretical studies corroborate well with the experimental, and compounds with the electron‐withdrawing group displayed better medicinal properties than their electron‐donating counterparts.',\n",

       "   'We investigated and compared the constituents, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities of the essential oils from the fresh and air- dried leaves of Icacina trichantha. The essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation, antimicrobial activities were tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Pleisomonas shigellosis, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis by agar diffusion method, while 2,2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used for the antioxidant activities at 6.25-200 μg/mL of the oils compared with ascorbic acid as standard. The fresh and air-dried leaf oils gave 0.39% (w/w) and 0.33% (w/w) corresponding to 17 compounds representing 99.99%, and 10 compounds representing 100% respectively. Major compounds in the fresh leaf oil were 9-oxabicyclo [6.1.0] nonane (15.52%), Methyl isododecanoate(11.91%), Oleic acid (10.51%), 3-Cyclohexen-1-ol,3-methyl-(8.24%) and Phytol (7.70%), while Linoleic acid- (34.61%), Palmitic acid (20.74%), 9,17-Octadecadienal, (Z)- (12.98%), 9-Octadecenal (Z) (7.96%) and gamma-sitosterol (7.13%) were the major constituents of the air-dried oil. The fresh leaf oil 50 mg/mL, gave the highest zone of inhibition of 12 mm against Candida albicans while the air-dried oil had the highest zone of inhibition of 18 mm with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.20 mg/mL against C. tropicalis. The fresh leaf oil had the highest antioxidant activity of 73.85% at 100 μg/mL, while the air-dried and ascorbic acid had 70.25% and 69.23% respectively at 200 μg/mL. The fresh leaf oil comprised mainly oxygenated hydrocarbons (52.51%) while the air-dried oil had fatty acids (58.44%). Both oils were more antifungal than antibacterial and had a comparable antioxidant activity with ascorbic acid.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['A neural network for software compensation was developed for the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL). The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.',\n",
       "   'The SiPM-on-Tile technology for highly granular calorimeters, where small plastic scintillator tiles are directly read out with SiPMs, has been developed for the CALICE Analog Hadron Calorimeter, and has been adopted for parts of the hadronic section of the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter. For future electron-positron colliders, a single cell time stamping on the sub-nanosecond level for energy deposits corresponding to single minimum-ionizing particles is desired to provide background rejection and to support pattern recognition and energy reconstruction with particle flow algorithms. To better understand the intrinsic time resolution achievable with the SiPM-on-Tile technology, we have performed detailed measurements in test beams at DESY, probing scintillator tiles of different sizes. The study is complemented by laser measurements that provide insights into processes within the scintillator tile relevant for timing. In this publication, we will discuss our measurement methods and the results of our SiPM-on-Tile timing study.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['For many decades, research studies have consistently shown that people who are visually impaired (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) are at substantially higher risk of nonfatal violent crimes than are their non-disabled peers (David et al., 1988; Gish, 1977; Pava, 1994). The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) implemented by the U.S. Department of Justice specifically defines these nonfatal violent crimes as including \"rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault\" (Harrell, 2021, p. 3). Four decades ago, Welbourne et al. (1983) reported that half of all women who were congenitally blind and participated in their study had experienced at least one incident (and often, more than one incident) of forced sexual contact. Two decades ago, it was found that three out of every four people with visual impairments have been physically assaulted in their lifetimes—a figure that was found to be 15 times greater than the figure for physical assaults among the general population (Collinsworth, 2001). Data pertaining to violent crimes against people with disabilities, including those who are visually impaired, from the most recent years are consistent with these data from the past several decades. The most recent National Crime Victimization Survey report showed that the rate of nonfatal violent crimes against people with visual impairments in the U.S. was nearly four times the rate for persons without disabilities (Harrell, 2021). Specifically, the rate of nonfatal violent crimes against people with visual impairments who were aged 12 and over was 47.6 per 1,000, compared to 12.4 per 1,000 among people without disabilities who were aged 12 and over (Harrell, 2021). Also, notably, of all the disability types measured by the National Crime Victimization Survey, those who identified as visually impaired had the second highest rate of nonfatal violent crimes, with cognitive disabilities being the only disability group that ranked higher (Harrell, 2021). Thus, nonfatal violent crimes, including \"rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault\" (Harrell, 2021, p. 3), against people who are visually impaired is a long-standing problem in dire need of attention.Pava (1994) explained several reasons for the greater incidence of physical and sexual assault against people who are visually impaired, and these reasons are still highly relevant today.Therefore, many people with visual impairments perceive themselves to be more vulnerable and at risk for physical attacks (Pava et al., 1991). These perceptions are rooted in a long history of people who are visually impaired not having adequate methods with which to protect themselves from a significantly high incidence of physical and sexual assault.This article shares methods that people with visual impairments can use to decrease their vulnerability to violent crimes. We include a brief discussion about strategies that are not recommended, and this is followed by an explanation of the environments in which these questionable strategies are intended to be implemented along with our rationale regarding their inappropriateness. We follow with our considerations regarding guide dogs, as related to the topic of personal safety. These discussions are followed by our recommendations for strategies that are low cost and require little to no training on the part of the person who is visually impaired.Commonly considered strategies for self-defense include the use of martial arts, spray irritants, and the long cane. We do not recommend these approaches for the reasons detailed below.A frequently recommended strategy for personal safety among people who are visually impaired is to become an expert in a martial art. We do not recommend that approach for several reasons. First, it is difficult to find martial arts trainers who are skilled in adapting techniques for use by individuals who are totally blind. Second, not all individuals who are blind possess the physical capability of mastering the techniques. Third, training in such self-defense strategies requires a considerable commitment of time for the initial training and subsequent practice to be proficient in the use of the strategies. These same disadvantages apply to any martial art that is specially designed for use by individuals who are blind.The use of pepper spray has unique disadvantages as a self-defense tool for people who are blind because they likely cannot detect where the pepper spray lands after it is discharged. The lack of control over where the spray hits is a strong disadvantage.We do not include the use of the long cane for protection. We realize that the use of the long cane as a weapon may be a seemingly convenient self-defense technique, but this scenario presents numerous hazards and risks. For example, a person who chooses to use their cane to defend themselves can be easily disarmed of the long cane by their attacker and could be left with no mobility tool with which to travel in their environment.We believe that there are other, more effective strategies to consider as primary methods of self-defense against a perpetrator. These methods and tools are outlined in this article. We emphasize that there is no way to guarantee complete safety for anyone using the tools or strategies that are described here. Therefore, we emphasize that the information presented in this article is designed to reduce vulnerability, not to guarantee safety.An additional point to be made here is that the recommendations are designed for use by people who are blind and who are traveling independently in the environment. The recommendations are not designed to protect individuals who are vulnerable to attack by family members or acquaintances of the family. These are dangers that unfortunately exist and require a completely separate discussion, apart from the information presented in this article.To begin, we believe that the most effective and most easily implemented strategy is the use of a trained guide dog. We understand that guide dogs are not trained to be guard dogs. We also understand from personal experience and existing research that individuals who belong to the sighted community view dogs as protective (American Kennel Club, 2021).We realize that this strategy, unlike those that follow, requires a substantial investment of time and effort on the part of the person who is visually impaired to acquire and maintain a guide dog. However, there is no special training required on the part of the guide dog or the person who is visually impaired in terms of the suggested personal safety benefit of guide dogs. It is simply the presence of a guide dog that likely makes a difference in terms of personal safety.Additionally, we present a novel concept that dogs of particular colors or breeds may decrease the likelihood of assault, merely based on the public\\'s perception of the particular dogs\\' aggression. We share this novel concept as a result of the personal experience of one of the authors, who has used three dogs, two of one color and one of another. He has noted that the colors of the dogs\\' coats have made a difference in the perception of the sighted public.In general, the colors of dogs may affect the perception of the aggression of the dogs, regardless of the breed. There is some scientific support for the concept that the color may cause some members of the public to view the dog as more or less dangerous. In a 2018 study conducted by Stanley Coren on behalf of the American Kennel Club, people rated photographs of Labrador Retrievers that differed only in color. The result showed that dogs with darker coats were perceived as more aggressive (Coren, 2018).Breed may also have an impact on the perception of a dog as a protector. A German shepherd, for example, is often seen as the most protective breed.(American Kennel Club, 2021). German Shepherds are often bred to be working dogs by the military and law enforcement, which are two highly protective career paths. Therefore, the general public may regard German Shepherd guide dogs as more protective of their owners.Based on these factors, individuals who are blind and who desire to travel using a guide dog may want to consider the breed and color of the dog. We make these suggestions as a novel concept for those who may be considering a guide dog for the first time. We also recognize that guide dog schools may not adhere to this novel suggestion about the consideration of guide dog color and/or breed in terms of protection from physical harm by strangers.The following recommendations are based on four requirements for inclusion. First, the tool must be accessible to people who are visually impaired to be recommended for use. Second, the tool must be inexpensive to be recommended for use. Third, the tool must be easily implemented without extensive training to be recommended for use. Last, the tool, of course, must be considered to be effective in reducing the individual\\'s vulnerability to sexual assault to be recommended for use. We have compiled a list of recommendations and tools that may be used to reduce the vulnerability of people who are blind to physical and sexual assault. Table summarizes the tools that are discussed in detail in the paragraphs that follow (Table).The Sting Ring is a small device that is carried in the palm of the hand. The user positions it so that a finger protrudes through the ring and the base of the device is held in the palm of the hand. The device has an on/off switch that can easily be manipulated by the thumb. The ring portion of the device produces an electrical charge. a bright light, and a loud sound.It is a \"taser-like\" device that, when triggered, emits a strong electrical charge while making a loud sound that results from the discharge of electricity. It is designed to be pressed against a portion of the body of an attacker while the palm of the hand is squeezed. That action causes the device to emit an electrical charge while producing a loud sound. The electrical charge produces a strong contraction of the muscles of the body in the location where the device is in contact. It is recommended that the electrical charge be induced for no longer than five seconds. The resulting contractions of the muscle as well as the pain are designed to cause an attacker to relent.The device has a recharging plug that can be inserted into a wall socket to renew the electrical charge of the device\\'s battery. The reader should be aware that \"taser-like\" devices, such as the Sting Ring, require the owner to hold a Firearms Owner Identification permit (FOID card) in some states. We believe that this small, relatively inexpensive device can be used with great effectiveness by a person who is blind. Sight is not required for its use. One need only be in physical contact with the recipient of the painful electrical charge. A person who is blind and who is being attacked will undoubtedly be in physical contact with their attacker, making the use of the device easily manageable. A second advantage of the Sting Ring is that it cannot easily be taken from the user because it is held in the palm of the hand with a finger protruding through the ring portion. A third advantage is that it cannot be easily used against the defender. If the person using this device for self-defense does not put pressure on it by squeezing the palm, it will not \"fire off\". A fourth advantage of the device is that the sound that it makes is alarming. We believe that merely pointing it at a potential attacker and causing it to fire off without actually touching the attacker would do much to discourage a perpetrator.The sound that the device makes and the spewing of the light of the electric charge may, in our estimation, discourage some people with visual impairments from using it. That same illusion of deadliness that discourages some people from using it may also have the same effect on potential attackers.The Sting Ring is found on the Home Security Superstore for the price of $18.95. The website where the Sting Ring can be found for purchase is available at https://www.thehomesecuritysuperstore.com/products/streetwise-sting-ring-knuckle-stun-gun-black-18m.For additional information about the Sting Ring, the reader is encouraged to view a YouTube video review of this device, located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmBB8tb8fqU. This particular video review describes the device in detail and includes a demonstration of the device being used to transmit its high voltage surge into the air, away from any person. It is a short video, 2 minutes and 25 seconds in length, that can answer many questions that readers may have about this device. Figures 1, 2, and 3 each show a picture of the Streetwise Sting Ring.The Cat Ear Spike Ring consists of a metal ring with two sharp spikes protruding from it. The ring can be worn on any of the fingers with the spikes pointing outward.There are several advantages of the Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring. It is inexpensive, does not require any kind of setup or charging, and is easy to conceal. This device is usable with and without vision. To our knowledge, its use is not forbidden by any legislation. It would be difficult for the attacker to take the ring away from the user or to use it against the person being attacked. The use of this device may be more acceptable by some people when compared with the previously mentioned Sting Ring. We note that there are also other similar defense rings available, such as the Defender Ring and other models. We have presented the Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring in particular because of its design elements of having two distinct, large spikes and a smooth side of the ring. This smooth side of the ring is distinct and has no spikes or tactile marks of any kind to allow the person wearing the ring to have the ring securely and properly worn when feeling the ring by touch.The use of the ring is obvious. Should a person be physically attacked, they would likely be in physical contact with the attacker. In that position, the person being attacked could administer a blow to any portion of the attacker\\'s body, hurting or puncturing the attacker\\'s skin with the sharp portion of the ring.There are certain disadvantages in the use of the Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring. The person defending themselves using this device must strike uncovered portions of the attacker\\'s body. The sharp portion of the ring may not penetrate thick clothing, especially if the person being attacked does not have considerable strength in their arms as they administer the blow or blows. The recommended approach is to strike the attacker\\'s face, but the person being attacked, not possessing sight, may have difficulty reaching the face of the attacker. Also, it might be the case that the attacker\\'s face is not readily accessible to the person being attacked.The Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring is found on various sites for various prices, ranging in cost from approximately $5 to approximately $20. A Google search using the terms \"Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring\" results in several sources from which this self-defense tool can be purchased. Figures 4 and 5 each show a picture of the Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring.There are numerous personal keychain alarms that can be purchased. Generally, these are inexpensive. Additionally, personal keychain alarms are easily carried and concealed, and they are usable with and without vision. There are no complex actions that must be taken to operate them; thus, the use of personal keychain alarms is easily learned without any required setup. Another advantage is that personal keychain alarms cannot be used against the person being attacked. The major disadvantage is that the alarm may be ignored by others, given the prevalence of car alarms, which are frequently heard in some environments.Personal keychain alarms are available on Amazon, ranging in price from $15 to $30 for a six-pack of multiple keychain alarms. Figures 6, 7, and 8 show pictures of an assortment of personal keychain alarms.The Care Go Personal Alarm is in the shape of a small cylinder, approximately three inches in length and approximately the diameter of a dime. The top third of the device is a triggering mechanism that the user can rotate and pull to engage the alarm. At the top of the device, a small connection allows it to be attached to a keychain. That portion of the device can be removed to gain access to the charging port. The device is linked to the Care Go App, which the owner of the device and their contacts of choice must download. The owner is required to pair the device with the Care Go App that is present on their phone. The instructions for this procedure are automatically started when the owner opens the app for the first time. The owner should ask friends or family members to download the Care Go App and designate themselves as \"protectors\". The device provides precise location details, and, using the app, the protectors can see the location of the device at all times. The device works in two ways. If the owner is moving through an environment and feels unsafe, they can twist the device to initiate the \"follow me\" mode. This action automatically sends a signal to the protectors\\' devices. As soon as the protectors touch the notifications on their phones and open the Care Go App, they can see the location of the phone owner. From the app, the protectors are able to determine the location of the owner. The individual being contacted can call the owner via the app. The protector can also track the movement of the owner via the app. In this way, the protectors are aware that their loved one feels unsafe and can reach out to them and/or easily observe their route.If the person who is blind feels they are in immediate danger, they can send an SOS signal to their contacts. This can be done by triggering the device by pulling the top, causing it to snap. The protectors\\' phones emit a loud sound that directs their immediate attention to the situation. The protectors can open the app, which will provide them with the location of the person. The protectors can call the owner if needed. If the owner twists the triggering mechanism and snaps it back down, then the \"follow me\" and SOS signals are cancelled. The protectors can still continue to view the owner\\'s location and check on them if they wish.The device has several advantages. It is small and easy to carry. This device and the Care Go App are accessible to people with visual impairments. The device has both a \"follow me\" and an SOS feature. Thus, protectors can discriminate between the person feeling unsafe or being in immediate danger and can take the appropriate action. According to the owner\\'s manual, the device needs to be charged only once a year. Perhaps the major advantage is that it is easier to manipulate than dialing a phone during an emergency because it requires only one small movement of the fingers to activate.The Care Go Personal Alarm is found on Amazon for approximately $45. Figure 9 is a picture of the Care Go Personal Alarm side by side a screen shot of a smart phone with the SOS Mode of the Care Go Alarm engaged.An SOS function can be found on many different types of smartphones. Thus, one major advantage is that there is no additional cost to invoke this on a smartphone that someone already owns. The SOS capability on iPhones and Android devices is accessible to people with visual impairments.This feature on iPhones enables one to immediately call emergency services after quickly clicking the power button (also known as the Sleep/Wake button) five times in a sequence. After pressing the power button five times quickly, an emergency SOS \"slider\" appears, enabling one to cancel the SOS alert signal by tapping the phone. If the alarm is not canceled, the phone is linked to a 911 operator. If the individual is unable to speak and has their medical ID imbedded in their phone, their ID card will be shared with local emergency services personnel. Once the call with emergency services personnel is concluded, the iPhone sends the emergency contacts a text message with the person\\'s current location. If the phone\\'s location identification capability is off, the phone will temporarily turn it on. When the person\\'s location changes, the person\\'s contacts will receive an update, and the contacts will receive a notification about 10 minutes later. Android phones have an SOS emergency feature that is set up in a similar manner and works in the same way. Clients and students who are visually impaired may require assistance in setting up their emergency contacts.There are several advantages of the SOS feature on smartphones. As mentioned, the feature is built into a smartphone. Generally, people nearly always have their phones in their possession, especially when traveling independently. Also, the feature is easy to set up for those who are familiar with the smartphone interface.A disadvantage of smartphone SOS functionality is that rapidly pressing the button several times in a row may be difficult to accomplish during an attack. Figure 10 shows screen shots of the iPhone SOS function and Figure 11 shows screen shots of the Android SOS function.Finally, we recommend that people who are visually impaired should be instructed on the use of their bodies to attempt to defend themselves. As stated earlier, we do not recommend training in any type of martial art, given the reasons previously stated. However, we do recommend that an individual who is being attacked should take actions that may stop the attacker. These involve maneuvers such as screaming and wildly thrashing about. An individual who is attacked can scratch, bite, kick, pinch, spit, pull hair, and perform any other action they can devise. A person who is being attacked can go limp and suddenly follow this by flailing wildly, twisting, jumping, and then going limp again and repeating the actions over and over.As explained by Bozeman (2004) \"the body can serve as a weapon for striking the attacker with the hands, fists, knees, feet, elbows, fingers, and head; biting; pinching; and/or yelling to attract attention\" (p. 436). An additional suggestion to attract attention when yelling is to yell \"fire\" instead of \"help\" because \"fire\" may trigger a quicker reaction from others who may hear the shouts.These maneuvers and techniques can be practiced by people who are visually impaired. It is important that the person who is visually impaired understands why they should appear to be in this crazed state when being attacked. The more difficult the person makes it for the attacker, the more difficult it is for the attacker to carry out any contemptible intentions. Additionally, these actions may draw the attention of others who may be in the area. If others are not in the area, these actions may cause the attacker to relent because of the possibility that others, unseen by the attacker, may view the actions that the attacker is attempting to carry out. If this approach is taken, we recommend that individuals who are blind be given the opportunity to practice these behaviors in a safe environment.There are many books on the topics of personal safety and empowerment that are readily accessible to people with visual impairments. While some of the books indicate by the title of the work that the content is written for women, the reality is that the safety tips apply to all humans, especially those who may be the most vulnerable, regardless of gender or gender identity status. Several examples of books that focus on physical safety and empowerment and are available on Bookshare and/or Audible include:Additionally, there are many self-help books that were written to aid in the recovery of rape and assault survivors. Many of these books are available on Bookshare and/or Audible and, therefore, are readily accessible to people with visual impairments. Examples of these books include the following:Physical and sexual assault among people who are visually impaired is a long-standing problem that has been documented in the literature for more than half a century. The purpose of this manuscript is to share meaningful methods and accessible tools that may be used to decrease vulnerability to physical and sexual assault for people with visual impairments.In conclusion, we do not want the reader to overestimate the effectiveness of the tools or actions presented in this manuscript. The use of a self-defense device will not guarantee that a person who is blind and traveling alone is invulnerable to assault. No strategy can guarantee total safety in today\\'s unfortunate environment. However, these tools and strategies are recommended to further empower people who are visually impaired throughout their lives.',\n",
       "   \"This chapter discusses what special education means for students with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) including what is being done and how traditions are maintained. More specifically, this chapter explores the importance of advancing values for the diverse population of students with visual impairments, focusing on cultivation of supportive, inclusive, and collaborative educational environments that continue to stand the test of time. This chapter highlights the increasing heterogeneity of this population of students and specific instructional strategies to support the cultural and linguistic diversity of learners with visual impairments in today's classrooms. This chapter also discusses the significance of promoting core concepts that are rooted in a traditional and specialized instructional framework for students who are visually impaired.\"],\n",

It was at those games that he won his first of three gold medals in heavyweight boxing and emerged as a Black celebrity, sports icon, and Cuban national hero. This article examines the overlapping and, at times, competing identities as they were constructed in Cuba's official discourse and in popular US and Cuban newspapers and magazines. The son of Black West Indian migrants, Stevenson stood out for more than his rejection of million-dollar offers to leave the island to pursue a professional boxing career in the United States. His remarks in support of the Cuban Revolution served as a kind of Black athletic activism that celebrated, at least implicitly, Cuba's progress on matters of racial equality and racial discrimination. RESUMEN: El afrocubano Teófilo Stevenson ingresó a la escena del boxeo mundial en los Juegos Olímpicos de 1972 en Múnich, Alemania. Fue en estos juegos donde él ganó la primera de sus tres medallas de oro en el boxeo de peso pesado y surgió como una celebridad negra, ícono deportivo y héroe nacional cubano. Este artículo examina estas identidades superpuestas y, a veces, en competencia, tal como fueron construidas en el discurso official de Cuba y en los periódicos y revistas populares de los Estados Unidos y Cuba. Hijo de inmigrantes antillanos, Stevenson se destacó por algo más que su rechazo de ofertas de millones de dólares para salir de la isla y seguir una carrera profesional en el boxeo en los Estados Unidos. Sus declaraciones en apoyo a la Revolución cubana sirvieron como un tipo de activismo atlético negro que celebraba, al menos implícitamente, el progreso de Cuba en materia de igualdad racial y discriminación racial.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['In the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S12.42-2010 standard for measuring insertion loss of hearing protection devices (HPDs) in impulsive noise, the range of peak sound pressure levels for the impulses is 132 to 168 dB peak sound pressure level (dB pSPL). The specification of the acoustic test fixtures (ATFs) included an IEC 60318-4 ear simulator fitted with a microphone. The microphones typically used are a ¼” cartridge and have a dynamic range up to about 169 dB pSPL. For most small caliber firearms, the peak SPLs are less than 170 dB SPL at the location of the shooters ear (Schulz et al. 2013). For some military weapon systems that produce impulses greater than 170 dB pSPL, impulse insertion loss cannot be assessed without exceeding the microphone maximum dynamic range. Some condenser microphones have maximum dynamic ranges of 190 dB pSPL. This paper compares insertion losses for HPDs measured on two GRAS 45CB ATFs with microphones with maximum dynamic ranges of 169 and 193 dB pSPL. Waveform distortion, field probe to unoccluded transfer functions between the ATF and field probe will be examined for distortion and accuracy when estimating the impulse level dependent attenuation.',\n",
       "   'The ANSI/ASA S12.42-2010 standard can be used to estimate the attenuation for impulsive noises between 130 and 170 decibels peak sound pressure level (dB pSPL). The ANSI/ASA S12.42 method uses a complex transfer function between the signal received in the ear of an acoustic test fixture (ATF) and a reference transducer. The reference transducer is at the same radial distance from the impulse source and at less than 30 degrees from the ATF angle. The reference transducer is specified as a pencil-type pressure (&amp;gt; 40.6 cm long). The maximum angle and the minimum pencil probe dimensions could be incompatible near the source, or may introduce artifacts or hazards. In this study, several hearing protectors were evaluated with two rifles (A-Bolt .300 Winchester Magnum and Colt AR-15 5.56 caliber), two ATFs (GRAS 45CB), and five transducers (four ¼” microphones and one surface mount microphone). The ATFs were on opposite sides of the gun at distances for field levels between 180- and 140-dB pSPL. For each location and rifle, S12.42 metrics were calculated for all 20 combinations of ATF ear and reference transducer. Results indicated that S12.42 metrics were minimally affected by the locations of the reference transducers.',\n",
       "   'Hearing protection devices (HPDs) and firearm suppressors can help mitigate risk of hearing loss from small caliber firearms. ANSI S12.42 is the standard for measuring HPD impulse peak insertion loss (IPIL). No consensus standard exists for measuring firearm suppressor noise reduction, though the industry is working toward a standard using maximum accumulated A-weighted energy. A common attenuation metric for different impulse noise reduction technologies would inform the individual and combined impact of these technologies. The maximum A-weighted energy reduction for several HPDs was assessed using firearm impulses from two rifles (0.300 Winchester Magnum and 5.56x45) with two ATFs and five field microphones positioned on opposite sides of the gun at four locations (field levels between 180- and 140-dB pSPL). No adjustments were made to account for tissue/bone conduction. Maximum A-weighted energy reduction values for single protection ranged between 17 dB (earmuff with safety glasses) and 43 dB (preformed earplug). Similar to IPIL, maximum A-weighted energy reduction increased with increased impulse levels. Advantages, disadvantages, and technical issues associated with the procedure will be discussed.',\n",
       "   'The EPA requirement for hearing protector labels is based on the decrepit ANSI S3.19-1974 standard, which prohibits the use of eyewear during the REAT testing that leads to the NRR on the product label. Firearm users are recommended to wear protective eyewear while shooting. In this presentation, we review past work regarding the effects of eyewear on earmuff performance and present results from five samples of one product that includes both eyewear and an earmuff. Impulses ranging between 139 and 178 dB peak SPL were used. Impulse Insertion Loss was less than 10 dB below 400 Hz for earmuffs alone and negligible for the earmuff and glasses condition and attenuation in the high frequencies was reduced by approximately 15 to 25 dB. Impulse peak insertion loss values per ANSI S12.42 were reduced from 21 to 39 dB for the earmuff alone to 15 to 22 dB when eye protection was added. Hearing conservation programs need to account for the deleterious effect of protective eyewear on earmuffs, and additional studies with broad combinations of earmuffs and eyewear are needed to establish the range over which eyewear can be expected to compromise earmuff attenuation.'],\n",

(2) Methods: Data on demographics, religiosity, family dynamics, and perceptions of public health efforts were collected through an online survey and compared to the rates of vaccine hesitancy and refusal. (3) Results: Income and sex were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. Based on a vaccine passport policy to enter public spaces, people who felt inhibited to enter public spaces or perceived privacy threats were twice as likely to exhibit vaccine hesitancy. Participants who believed that religious groups had a difficult time getting vaccinated were nearly twice as likely to exhibit vaccine hesitancy and three times more likely to exhibit vaccine refusal. However, participants who believed in a higher religious power were 58% less likely to exhibit vaccine hesitancy. Religious leaders significantly influenced participants to make the decision regarding vaccination. Individuals with vaccine refusal were more than twice as likely to share information with others without fact-checking. Notably, structural barriers such as distance and transportation were most strongly associated with vaccine hesitancy and refusal. (4) Conclusion: Cultural factors play a significant role in vaccine hesitancy and refusal. The SEM can be used to propose multi-level interventions with collaboration and communication among stakeholders to improve community health.',\n",
       "   'A comparative assessment of the risks of the three current wastewater effluent disposal options and three other potential options was conducted for Southeast Florida communities. The question was how the risk to humans from the use of potable reuse compares to the other five available wastewater disposal alternatives. The need for this type of risk assessment is due to the potential to use potable reuse as a water supply and the potential resistance from the public as a result of such a proposal. Water quality data relevant to disposal of wastewater treatment plant effluent from South Florida utilities along with water quality data on the receiving waters and drinking water standards were obtained for the project. The comparison of the public health risks associated with these disposal alternatives indicated that health risks associated with deep wells and direct potable reuse were generally lower than those of the other alternatives.',\n",

The alternatives are: 1) deep well injection 2) ocean outfalls following secondary treatment, 3) surface water (canal) discharges following secondary wastewater treatment, filtration and nutrient removal, 4) reclaimed water (secondary treatment plus filtration and high-level disinfection, 5) indirect potable reuse (full treatment with reverse osmosis, plus ultraviolet light and advanced oxidation) and 6) direct potable reuse using reverse osmosis, ultraviolet light and advanced oxidation. Water quality data was gathered from a series of south Florid utilities, south Florida test facilities, receiving waters and other relevant locations to south Florida wastewater effluent disposal. This paper presents the conclusions regarding relative health concerns associated with these disposal alternatives. The results indicated that health risks associated with deep wells and direct potable reuse were generally lower than those of the other alternatives.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Introduction: Hemp and other natural fibers are seeing greater use in the industry due to their useful mechanical properties and sustainability. Natural fibers can reinforce or fill polymers to reduce cost and increase biodegradability. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) exhibits exceptional toughness and is capable of being mixed with natural fibers Materials and Methods: In this study, hemp fiber, in powder form, has been blended with UHMWPE powder and processed by compression molding to evaluate mechanical strength properties. The effects of adding low molecular weight polyethylene wax (PE-wax), a property modifier, were also examined. The hemp content of the compositions was 0, 20, 40, 60% w/w, with and without the wax. Results: Consistent with filler behavior, the addition of hemp significantly reduces the ultimate and yield tensile strengths as well as the elongation at break; the effect increases with more hemp. PE-wax improves performance at 40% and 60% w/w hemp, compared to the no wax condition. The presence of hemp increases the elastic modulus for 20% and 40% w/w hemp, and PE-wax improves the elastic modulus at all hemp concentrations. Compressive strength declines as hemp content increases, and the wax raises the performance at all hemp levels, nearly doubling the 20% w/w hemp strength. Shore type D hardness values steadily decline with hemp content, with a 60% loss in hardness, from the pure UHMWPE baseline to the 60% w/w hemp sample. Conclusion: The simplified process outlined in this study produced materials that are fit for use in engineered applications. The process was also much simpler than traditional hand lay-up techniques, making it attractive for use in industrial applications.',\n",
       "   'Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for 74% of deaths annually. Satellite imagery provides previously unattainable data about factors related to NCDs that overcome limitations of traditional, non-satellite-derived environmental data, such as subjectivity and requirements of a smaller geographic area of focus. This systematic literature review determined how satellite imagery has been used to address the top NCDs in the world, including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.',\n",
       "   'Few studies have examined the association between green space and life expectancy, and only one study has looked at that data for small areas in the United States. These studies have found a positive association between green space and life expectancy. This study investigates the association between green space and small-area life expectancy in Chicago, a city in the United States with distinct environmental and socioeconomic characteristics and the largest U.S. life expectancy gap between neighborhoods. We conducted a spatial analysis using the green space metrics of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), park access, and tree canopy. Additionally, we included 18 lifestyle, environmental, and social covariates. Diagnostic analytics included multiple linear regression, Moran I test for spatial dependence, and principal component analysis with CAR Gaussian model. We performed a simulation to predict life expectancy gain if NDVI was brought to median levels. Our study revealed that after adjusting for covariates and spatial dependence (Moran I test p = 0.012) with a CAR Gaussian model, NDVI (credible interval = 0.292-0.894) demonstrated significance at a 5 % level, while tree canopy (credible interval = -0.404-0.109) and park access (credible interval = -0.258-0.161) did not. Excluding non-significant variables (tree canopy and park access) from the CAR Gaussian model, the median effect of NDVI on life expectancy was 0.491 (95 % credible interval: 0.24–0.718). Projecting this effect to tracts below the median NDVI predicted a gain of 476,000 years of life expectancy for Chicago residents. This study provides evidence that green space and LE are positively correlated, suggesting the potential to increase green space to address current LE gaps. Future research should investigate the mechanisms by which green space correlates to lifespan.'],\n",

       "   \"Purpose: When performing nuclear medicine examinations, body wraps or plastic supports are used to support and immobilize the patient's upper extremities to prevent patient safety accidents. However, the existing plastic supports compromised patient and staff safety, including finger entrapment and falls. Moreover, the body wrap provided by manufacturers compromised image quality such as upper extremities cutoff during whole body bone scan. Therefore, a new design of body wrap was developed to improve the issue, and this study aims to evaluate the usability of this medical body wrap. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the usability of the newly designed medical body wrap, a quality assessment of whole body bone scan images and a user satisfaction survey were conducted. Adult patients (male:female=129:152, age: 60.3±12.4 years, BMI: 24.0±4.2) aged 16 years or older who underwent a whole body bone scan during two periods: June to July 2022 (before improvement, n=139) and June to July 2023 (after improvement, n=142) were randomly selected for image quality evaluation. Five radiotechnologists visually evaluated the posterior view of the whole body bone image, including the left and right elbow (2 points), arm (2 points), whether the hand is extended (2 points), whether the hand is included (2 points), and the number of visible fingers (10 points), with a total of 18 points, which were converted to 100 points and analyzed for difference before and after improvement using an independent sample t-test. The user satisfaction questionnaire was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale among 16 radiotechnologists from three general hospitals who experienced the new body wrap. Results: The image quality assessment was 82.0±13.8 before the improvement and 89.3±10.1 after the improvement, an average of 7.3 points higher, with a statistically significant difference (t=5.02, p&lt;0.01). The user satisfaction survey showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.1±0.8 for ease of use, 3.8±0.7 for scan preparation time, 3.9±0.7 for patient safety, 3.8±1.2 for scan accuracy, and 4.2±0.7 for recommendation (87.5% questionnaire response rate). Conclusion: The developed body wrap showed higher image quality and user satisfaction compared to the old method. Considering these results, it is deemed that the new body wrap may be more useful than existing methods.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer of plasma cells with a 5‐year survival rate of 59%. Dysregulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism is associated with MM development and progression; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we explore the roles of long‐chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligase (ACSL) family members in MM. ACSLs convert free long‐chain fatty acids into fatty acyl‐CoA esters and play key roles in catabolic and anabolic fatty acid metabolism. Analysis of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) CoMMpass SM study showed that high ACSL1 and ACSL4 expression in myeloma cells are both associated with worse clinical outcomes for MM patients. Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) data showed that all five ACSLs have negative Chronos scores, and ACSL3 and ACSL4 were among the top 25% Hallmark Fatty Acid Metabolism genes that support myeloma cell line fitness. Inhibition of ACSLs in myeloma cell lines in vitro , using the pharmacological inhibitor Triacsin C (TriC), increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and decreased cell viability, in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner. RNA‐sequencing analysis of MM.1S cells treated with TriC showed a significant enrichment in apoptosis, ferroptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and proteomic analysis of these cells revealed enriched pathways for mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation. TriC also rewired mitochondrial metabolism by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing mitochondrial superoxide levels, decreasing mitochondrial ATP production rates, and impairing cellular respiration. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that suppression of ACSLs in myeloma cells is a novel metabolic target in MM that inhibits their viability, implicating this family as a promising therapeutic target in treating myeloma.',\n",

       "   'ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer of plasma cells with a 5-year survival rate of 59%. Dysregulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism is associated with MM development and progression; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family members (ACSLs) convert free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters and play key roles in catabolic and anabolic fatty acid metabolism. The Cancer Dependency Map data suggested that ACSL3 and ACSL4 were among the top 25% Hallmark Fatty Acid Metabolism genes that support MM fitness. Here, we show that inhibition of ACSLs in human myeloma cell lines using the pharmacological inhibitor Triascin C (TriC) causes apoptosis and decreases proliferation in a dose– and time-dependent manner. RNA-seq of MM.1S cells treated with TriC for 24 h showed a significant enrichment in apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ER stress. Proteomics of MM.1S cells treated with TriC for 48 h revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly enriched pathways of interest, consistent with our observations of decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitochondrial superoxide levels. Interestingly, MM.1S cells treated with TriC for 24 h also showed decreased mitochondrial ATP production rates and overall lower cellular respiration. Implications Overall, our data support the hypothesis that suppression of ACSL in human MM cells inhibit their growth and viability, indicating that ACSL proteins may be promising therapeutic targets in treating myeloma progression.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"A breast cancer diagnosis can impact every aspect of a woman's life, particularly for women diagnosed before age 45 when they are in the process of establishing stability in their personal and professional lives. This study investigated the impact of a breast cancer diagnosis on employment, finances, and personal relationships among young breast cancer survivors. We conducted descriptive statistical analysis of survey data from 315 women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45. Surveys were administered electronically and included 40 questions on demographics asking about employment, insurance, income, and marital status at two time points: at diagnosis and at the time the survey was completed. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted. The McNemar-Bowker Test of Symmetry was used to calculate the significance of changes in employment, insurance, income, and marital status at the two time points. We found significant changes following diagnosis in employment and insurance. Prior to diagnosis, 68.6% of respondents were employed full time, compared to 52.4% following diagnosis – falling from 212 to 162 respondents. Individuals who were unable to work increased by 14.6% after diagnosis, rising from 4 to 49 respondents. The decline in full-time employment was highest among those with a diagnosis of Stage IV cancer (33.9%), with the number of full-time worker respondents falling from 79 to 41. We found a significant change in insurance (p < .001) with a decline in individuals with private or no insurance of 4.7% and 3.4%, respectively, while those with public insurance increased by 8.1%. Our findings suggest that young breast cancer survivors are particularly vulnerable to changes in employment, with more than a tenfold increase in the number of young women who reported being unable to work following diagnosis. Our findings also indicate a significant shift from private to public insurance, particularly for individuals living with Stage IV cancer. These results point to opportunities to address the specific needs of young women diagnosed with breast cancer and improve their overall quality of life.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract Background: Splenectomy is indicated as a therapeutic option in different types of hereditary blood disorders. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the outcome of splenectomy in children with beta-thalassemia major (BTM) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in Basrah-Iraq on children with BTM and SCD who had undergone open splenectomy in the period between January 2016 and December 2019 at our institution. Results: The study included 87 children (49 males and 38 females). 59.8% with SCD and 35 (40.2%) with BTM. The mean age was 8.46 range (3–15) years. The mean weight was 23.51 range (11–45) kg. In SCD, the major indication (71.1%) was acute splenic sequestration (ASS). Postsplenectomy outcome in BTM included improvement in the median hemoglobin (Hb) level by 2.1 g/dL, reduction in the median packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion frequency by 19/year, and reduction in the median PRBC requirement by 190 mL/kg/year. In SCD, improvement in the median Hb level by 1.55 g/dL, reduction in the median PRBC transfusion frequency by 4.5/year, and reduction in the median PRBC requirement by 45 mL/kg/year. In addition, splenectomy eliminated life-threatening ASS crisis. Postoperative complications were observed in 6.9% of patients. Conclusions: SCD was the main hematological condition requiring splenectomy. ASS was the main indication for splenectomy in SCD. Splenectomy has proved beneficial in the management of SCD and BTM patients. Furthermore, it is now recognized as a safe surgery with a low complication rate.',\n",
       "   'Abstract TAE Technologies’ fifth-generation fusion device, C-2W (also called ‘Norman’), is the world’s largest compact-toroid device and has made significant progress in field-reversed configuration (FRC) plasma performance. C-2W produces record breaking, macroscopically stable, high-temperature advanced beam-driven FRC plasmas, dominated by injected fast particles and sustained in steady state, which is primarily limited by neutral-beam (NB) pulse duration. The NB power supply system has recently been upgraded to extend the pulse length from 30 ms to 40 ms, which allows for a longer plasma lifetime and thus better characterization and further enhancement of FRC performance. An active plasma control system is routinely used in C-2W to produce consistent FRC performance as well as for reliable machine operations using magnet coils, edge-biasing electrodes, gas injection and tunable-energy NBs. Google’s machine learning framework for experimental optimization has also been routinely used to enhance plasma performance. Dedicated plasma optimization experimental campaigns, particularly focused on the external magnetic field profile and NB injection (NBI) optimizations, have produced a superior FRC plasma performance; for instance, achieving a total plasma energy of ∼13 kJ, a trapped poloidal magnetic flux of ∼16 mWb (based on the rigid-rotor model) and plasma sustainment in steady state up to ∼40 ms. Furthermore, under some operating conditions, the electron temperature of FRC plasmas at a quiescent phase has successfully reached up to ∼1 keV at the peak inside the FRC separatrix for the first time. The overall FRC performance is well correlated with the NB and edge-biasing systems, where higher total plasma energy is obtained with higher NBI power and applied voltage on biasing electrodes. C-2W operations have now reached a mature level where the machine can produce hot, stable, long-lived, and repeatable plasmas in a well-controlled manner.'],\n",

This study examined the feasibility and physiological (heart rate, blood pressure, blood lactate, and rate of perceived exertion) and psychological (enjoyment) response resulting from an acute progressive sled-push (SLP) exercise session using the novel XPO Sled Trainer in older adults and compared that with walking (WKC) condition. The exercise session comprised six exercise bouts at 75%, 85%, 100% (2×), and 125% (2×) of normal velocity with a 2-min rest between bouts. Thirty-six older adults were randomly allocated into either the SLP or WKC conditions. No adverse events were observed during the exercise session, and all participants completed the exercise protocol as prescribed. One-third of the participants in the SLP group reported minimal body discomfort. Significantly higher responses were observed for all physiological variables as the intensity of the exercise increased in the SLP group compared with the WKC group ( p &lt; .001). The SLP group presented a decline in enjoyment as the intensity of the exercise increased (during), but similar enjoyment level than the WKC group for the overall exercise session ( p = .711). Our findings support the viability and safety of SLP exercise using the XPO Sled Trainer in older adults. Such exercise demonstrated an intensity-driven modality that may have potential to elucidate positive adaptations in the cardiovascular system of older adults with acceptable levels of enjoyment.',\n",
       "   'Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) impacts 50% of U.S. adults although few studies evaluate young adults’ cardiovascular disease risk. Early identification of cardiovascular disease risk may mitigate increased adulthood incidence. We analyzed (CVD) risk factors and their association with cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text] o 2 max) to devise effective strategies to improve cardiovascular health across the lifespan. Methods A cross-sectional study evaluated the effect of a single bout of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular disease risk factors in adults aged 18 to 36 years. Glycemic control (HbA 1C ), cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text]o 2 max), percent body fat, lean body mass, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. Results Statistically significant relationships were observed between percent body fat (r = .83, P &lt; .001) and BMI, and waist circumference (r = .83, P &lt; .001) and BMI. Percent body fat ( P &lt; .001) and race ( P = .018) predicted exercise time, with Asians exercising the longest. Percent fat ( P &lt; .001) and HbA 1C ( P = .039) were identified as predictors of cardiovascular fitness which was low in spite of primarily normal average HbA 1C levels. Conclusions HbA 1C and body fat negatively influence cardiovascular fitness ([Formula: see text] o 2 max) in young adults increasing adulthood cardiovascular disease risk. Research investigating the effect of HbA 1C on cardiovascular health especially in youth is warranted.',\n",
       "   'Aim: Social media leisure time activities have become a very popular activity in Worldwide, and with an increase in social media use research has shown a similar decline in physical participation and a decrease in aerobic capacity. Decreases in physical activity time have been positivity associated with an increase for all-cause mortality and the increased risk development for obesity and cardiovascular disease conditions. Methods: A sample of the Northern Illinois student body (n = 161) was examined for associations between social media time on markers of aerobic fitness capacity and daily physical activity. Institution Review Board consent was given, and subjects then were asked to complete a 7-day recall to assess their social media usage, which was interview administered, had a bioimpedance analysis scan, completed a PACER aerobic fitness test, and wore a pedometer for seven days to assess steps per day. Results: Subjects were classified depending on their social media time usage as infrequent users, moderate users, and frequent users by percentile ranks. PACER scores were reduced in the frequent users compared to the infrequent users and this was statistically significant (p = .027). Steps per day exhibited similar trends with a decreased step count per day for the frequent users compared to the infrequent users (p = .023). Conclusions: College students who engage in a greater volume of social media use per day displayed a greater decrease in aerobic fitness as assessed by the PACER test and exhibited a greater decline in physical activity quantified by steps taken per day.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The software development process heavily relies on building systems, which are prone to frequent failures, particularly in continuous integration (CI) environments. In this study, we investigated the impact of major change types, both individually and collectively, on CI build failure rates. Specifically, we compared the contribution of changes stemming from different underlying reasons, such as functional requirement additions, bug fixes, enhancements, and dependency removals. Preliminary results revealed that adding new functionalities had a lower impact on CI failures compared to maintenance changes. Furthermore, we analyzed the characteristics of the ultimate changes to identify common features among the change types that contributed to failures. Subsequently, utilizing these identified features, we developed a mathematical model to predict failures based on the characteristics of the triggering change type. The trained model demonstrated a commendable performance, accurately identifying potential failure-inducing changes in the dataset, with a recall of 78% and precision of 53%. This research sheds light on the relationship between change types and CI build failures, highlighting the significance of maintenance changes in driving failures. The identification of common features among failure- contributing change types aids in understanding failure patterns and supports the development of preventive measures. The predictive model offers a practical tool for early detection and mitigation of potential failures, contributing to improved software development processes and the adoption of effective CI practices.',\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract Cambodia’s constitution reflects the efforts of Western governments, international organizations, and negotiators to reach a lasting solution to decades of civil war and foreign occupation. Although it was drafted along the lines of Western liberal democratic principles and the rule of law, the government’s adherence to the constitution has been problematic due to the country severely lacking in legal capacity, experience with democratic governance, and conception of substantive rule of law principles. Constitutional amendments have been undertaken with the aims of resolving conflicts among elites and supporting the ruling Cambodian People’s Party. While Cambodian leaders argue that concepts like rule of law should be defined in ways that reflect the country’s cultural values and level of development, legal development has been challenged by decades of social, political, and economic turmoil, patronage-based politics, and an increasingly dominant executive power as liberalizing foreign influences on the legal system have dwindled.'],\n",

Framed in variables from expectancy violation theory and communication competence, the experiment (N = 480) indicated that violation valence, violation importance, and violation expectedness were influenced by faculty responses (or lack of response) to off-task cell phone use. In addition, communication competence judgments were influenced by faculty responses to cell phone use. Academic entitlement was also negatively associated with violation importance and perceptions of faculty appropriateness. The most expected and appropriate response reported was faculty requesting that students put away their cell phones rather than assigning a point deduction or ignoring the off-task cell phone use.',\n",

Specifically, tobacco use is linked to high poverty across the state and disproportionately affects African Americans. A faith-based tobacco prevention network was formed to address these concerns and increase education and cessation. The West Virginia African American Tobacco Prevention Network (WVAATPN) was formed in 2021 and since then has expanded its reach across the state, involving 22 congregations. The Network’s model includes annual training for lay leaders on various tobacco-related topics, tailored educational curriculum for congregations, and collaboration with national experts to enhance program efficacy. The Network has run educational and cessation workshops and promoted events such as No Menthol Sunday. Workshops have yielded positive outcomes among participants, including increased awareness of tobacco marketing tactics, higher cessation rates, and improved understanding of the health impacts of tobacco. The WVAATPN continues to expand its reach and effectiveness by advocating for policy change, enhancing community engagement, and fostering partnerships to combat tobacco-related disparities in West Virginia’s African American communities.'],\n",

Instead of using specialized computer-aided auditing tools, this teaching case purports to apply Microsoft Excel to demonstrate the process, applicability, and benefits of Benford’s Law by analyzing publicly available datasets on confirmed COVID-19 and credit card fraud cases. This hands-on exercise also enhances students’ Excel skills to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data and use various data visualizations (e.g., pie/100 percent stacked/combo charts) to display proportional information.

       "   \"Background: Erythromelalgia, which has primary and secondary presentations, causes heat, pain, and redness in the skin. The condition seems to have an autonomic basis, with vasomotor dysfunction causing dilatation of some blood vessels and constriction of others. No consistently effective treatments have been reported. Anticonvulsant, antidepressant, antihistamine, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, analgesic, nutritional, and topical approaches have been tried as were lidocaine infusions, nerve blocks, and thoracic and lumbar sympathectomies. Interosseous membrane stimulation appears to affect the local autonomic milieu in the extremity being treated. This approach was used on a patient with erythromelalgia. Case: A 36-year-old woman with erythromelalgia was treated with interosseous membrane stimulation. Eight treatments were given over a 1-year timeframe at 1–3-month intervals. Results: This patient repeatedly experienced much relief from her burning paresthesias, swelling, diaphoresis, and ruddy discoloration of her extremities for 6–8 hours following each treatment. The intensity of her discomfort subsided gradually over time. Conclusions: Interosseous membrane stimulation is a safe, simple, and effective treatment for erythromelalgia, which is notoriously refractory to treatment. This patient's response to treatment might have been a result of localized derangement of her autonomic nervous system. It is possible that manipulation of the autonomic milieu of an extremity is a significant factor in the mechanism of action of interosseous membrane stimulation.\"],\n",

By identifying, tracking, and cataloguing snowstorms, we illustrate how the frequency, snow water equivalent, and other features of these events may change. Results suggest changes in snowstorm characteristics are most significant for the pessimistic pathway, especially toward the late 21st century. There is similar event frequency between the historical period and mid‐21st‐century projections but declines of 3% to 10% are still projected for snowstorm counts, hours, cumulative area, and snow water equivalent. By the late 21st century, snowstorm attributes have losses of 6% to 37% versus the historical period, revealing a projected acceleration in loss from the mid to late century. Spatially, snowstorm reduction is most dramatic along and south of the Ohio River Valley as the latitude that separates steady snowstorm counts to the north and reduced snowstorms to the south migrates poleward in the future. Similarly, extreme snowstorms decline to the south, with some northern regions experiencing increase in counts and snow water equivalent, affirming prior research theorising that some snowfall may intensify as increasing moisture in a warming climate interacts with environments with temperatures still supportive of snowfall. Significant reductions in early and late cool‐season snowstorms are projected across all future epochs, revealing a shrinking season. These results provide a set of perspectives on how a dominant cryospheric input—the snowstorm—will change across eastern North America in the future.',\n",
       "   \"Changes in the properties of severe climatic events like rainstorms and droughts are expected to impact erosion rates significantly under modern global warming. Also over the recent geologic past and especially in drylands catchments, hydrological and vegetation transitions following changes in spatiotemporal properties of climatic phenomena have been suggested as triggers for periods of enhanced erosion that affected societies' sustainability and left pronounced topographic imprints. However, these potential drivers remain incompletely understood and quantified. This is, in part, because the discrete events that trigger erosion are hard to observe and the fine-scale processes needed to model erosion are computationally intensive to run over landscape evolution timescales.To address this, we developed a new catchment-scale landscape evolution model based on the Landlab toolkit that explicitly represents episodic failures, sub-minute hydrology, overland-driven sediment transport, and erosion-vegetation links. We validated the model against event-based runoff and sediment records from the Lucky Hills site in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona, USA. After validation, we conducted a set of stochastic numerical experiments of landscape evolution in response to changes in sub-daily rainfall distribution, without considering changes in vegetation properties. We ran an additional set of simulations that integrated the landscape evolution model with historical and future climate records for the High Plains of Colorado, driven by a convection-permitting weather model (CPM). This experimental set allows us to explore changes in vegetation cover and its influence on sediment yield and topographic evolution under modern global warming.We found that changes in the tail of the sub-daily rainfall distribution&amp;#8212;changes similar to recent observations under modern global warming&amp;#8212;could raise the total sediment yield by ~40% and alter the catchment morphology. Modeled sediment yield increased in response to the rising frequency of rare, high-magnitude storms, even when there was no significant change in the mean storm properties or annual rainfall. Further, we found that catchment erosion could increase even under a reduction in the mean conditions if the sub-daily rainfall distribution shifted toward a heavier tail. Numerical experiments driven by the CPM data confirm that under projected future conditions in the High Plains, erosion is expected to increase, even though the mean conditions become drier. Our simulations also reveal that the presence of vegetation impacts the morphology of the catchment, reducing channel density and preserving gullies' headcuts. Overall, this study contributes insight into the role of rainstorm properties and vegetation cover on landscape evolution, illuminates potential climatic triggers for past aggradation and degradation stages in low-order catchments, and provides valuable information for erosion risks under anthropogenic climatic and environmental changes.\",\n",
       "   \"Abstract Precise, accurate, and reliable crop condition data continues to be in demand for farmers, agribusiness, government agencies, agroclimatologists, and research institutions. This study evaluated the data quality of four major United States field crops: corn ( Zea mays L.), cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), soybeans ( Glycine max L.), and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's (NASS) Gridded Crop Progress and Condition dataset. Upon aggregating the weekly 9 km gridded data to the county level (and further to the state and national level) over the 2015–2023 period, no statistically significant differences emerged between the gridded condition data and the tabular condition data from the USDA NASS Crop Progress and Condition Report (CPCR). In line with state and national‐level analyses, a strong linear relationship between crop conditions and yield existed at the county scale. County‐level crop condition ratings were a statistically significant covariate of yield during the critical reproduction period through harvest for 90% of corn, 78% of cotton, 90% of soybean, and 96% of winter wheat‐producing counties. In addition, intramonthly county‐level crop conditions changed accordingly based on the magnitude of temperature and precipitation anomalies during certain phenological stages. In at least 80% of counties for each respective crop, temperatures and precipitation were statistically significant covariates for crop condition changes. The relationships between USDA NASS gridded crop condition data, CPCR data, yield, and climate substantiate the utility and fidelity of this dataset as a representation of confidential crop condition reports, supporting its practical application in research and operational decision‐making.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Elevated mixed layers (EMLs) influence the severe convective storm climatology in the contiguous United States (CONUS), playing an important role in the initiation, sustenance, and suppression of storms. This study creates a high-resolution climatology of the EML to analyze variability and potential changes in EML frequency and characteristics for the first time. An objective algorithm is applied to ERA5 to detect EMLs, defined in part as layers of steep lapse rates (≥8.0°C km −1 ) at least 200 hPa thick, in the CONUS and northern Mexico from 1979 to 2021. EMLs are most frequent over the Great Plains in spring and summer, with a standard deviation of 4–10 EML days per year highlighting sizable interannual variability. Mean convective inhibition associated with the EML’s capping inversion suggests many EMLs prohibit convection, although—like nearly all EML characteristics—there is considerable spread and notable seasonal variability. In the High Plains, statistically significant increases in EML days (4–5 more days per decade) coincide with warmer EML bases and steeper EML lapse rates, driven by warming and drying in the low levels of the western CONUS during the study period. Additionally, increases in EML base temperatures result in significantly more EML-related convective inhibition over the Great Plains, which may continue to have implications for convective storm frequency, intensity, severe perils, and precipitation if this trend persists. Significance Statement Elevated mixed layers (EMLs) play a role in the spatiotemporal frequency of severe convective storms and precipitation across the contiguous United States and northern Mexico. This research creates a detailed EML climatology from a modern reanalysis dataset to uncover patterns and potential changes in EML frequency and associated meteorological characteristics. EMLs are most common over the Great Plains in spring and summer, but show significant variability year-to-year. Robust increases in the number of days with EMLs have occurred since 1979 across the High Plains. Lapse rates associated with EMLs have trended steeper, in part due to warmer EML base temperatures. This has resulted in increasing EML convective inhibition, which has important implications for regional climate.',\n",
       "   'Hailstorms are analyzed across the United States using explicit hailstone size calculations from convection-permitting regional climate simulations for historical, mid-century, and end of twenty-first-century epochs. Near-surface hailstones <4 cm are found to decrease in frequency by an average of 25%, whereas the largest stones are found to increase by 15–75% depending on the greenhouse gas emissions pathway. Decreases in the frequency of near-surface severe hail days are expected across the U.S. High Plains, with 2–4 fewer days projected—primarily in summer. Column-maximum severe hail days are projected to increase robustly in most locations outside of the southern Plains, a distribution that closely mimics projections of thunderstorm days. Primary mechanisms for the changes in hailstone size are linked to future environments supportive of greater instability opposed by thicker melting layers. This results in a future hailstone size dichotomy, whereby stronger updrafts promote more of the largest hailstones, but significant decreases occur for a majority of smaller diameters due to increased melting.',\n",
       "   'Abstract USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service general crop condition data are used to quantify the relationship between crop conditions and yield, condition tendencies during the growing season, how conditions vary across the United States, and how conditions have trended for the 1986–2022 period for a variety of crops: barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), corn ( Zea mays L.), cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.), oats ( Avena sativa L.), peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea L.), rice ( Oryza sativa L.), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L.), soybeans ( Glycine max L.), and spring and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Crop conditions are a statistically significant covariate (90% significance level) for yield and can be used in practice on a weekly basis. This becomes increasingly important as, historically, crop conditions not only deteriorated on average, but also became more variable throughout the growing season. Spatial differences in conditions, variability, and trends in condition ratings and variability are caused by crop selection, regional climate, and management practices such as irrigation. Crop conditions were poorest and had the highest interannual variability across the southern Great Plains region. Since 1986, crop conditions in the Great Plains region have deteriorated significantly, while variability has increased. Meanwhile, crop conditions across the southwestern and southeastern United States have significantly improved, while interannual variability in conditions has experienced robust declines. Given climatic and hydrologic trends, to maintain a positive trend in yield, continued advancements in production management and technology are required. Critical decisions regarding real‐time or future management can be supplemented by using crop condition risk assessment information along with actively monitoring weekly conditions.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract This research seeks to understand simulated supercell precipitation characteristics across the conterminous United States (CONUS) using high‐resolution, convection‐permitting, dynamically downscaled simulations for three 15‐year epochs. Epochs include a historical end‐of‐20th‐century period (1990–2005) and two end‐of‐21st‐century (2085–2100) scenarios for intermediate and pessimistic greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Simulated updraft helicity, which measures the corkscrew flow within a storm's updraft, is used as a proxy for supercells. An algorithm tracks and catalogues updraft helicity swaths that, when buffered, are used to acquire simulated precipitation from supercells. The historical epoch provides a baseline climatology of supercell precipitation for a contemporary climate, which is then compared against the two future epochs to assess how supercell precipitation may change during the 21st century. Despite their relatively small size, supercells provide critical precipitation to the Wheat and Corn Belts, large expanses of CONUS pasture and rangeland, regional aquifers and several large river basins. Many areas in the central CONUS receive upwards of 3%–6% of their annual and 5%–8% of their warm‐season precipitation from these storms. Results suggest that precipitation contribution from supercells will decrease in the future across most of the High Plains and Central and Northern Great Plains with robust increases likely across the south‐central and Southeast regions. Supercell precipitation rates are expected to increase for large portions of the CONUS by the end‐of‐the‐21st‐century, suggesting a growing threat for flash floods from these storms as they become more efficient precipitation producers. This research provides an initial perspective on the magnitude of supercell precipitation and potential changes to this important hydrologic input to assist water‐sensitive industries, private and public insurance markets, agriculture entities, as well as inform plans to mitigate and build resilience to rapid environmental and societal change.\",\n",

       "   'Abstract The potential for changes in extreme precipitation events due to anthropogenic climate change may have significant societal impacts (e.g., agricultural productivity, property loss, mortality). This project uses a dynamically downscaled, convection-permitting regional climate model to investigate extreme daily precipitation in the CONUS, defined explicitly as the 99th percentile 24-h accumulated value. The simulation output includes a historical baseline (HIST; 1990–2005) and two epochs at the end of the twenty-first century (EOC; 2085–2100) under intermediate and pessimistic emissions scenarios. Independent observations illustrate that HIST admirably represents extreme precipitation climatology for most locations in the domain. Comparisons between HIST and the two EOC scenarios for the 99th percentile of daily precipitation show statistically significant increases during Dec–May across the Midwest and Ohio Valley and statistically significant decreases for the southern Great Plains during Dec–Feb. Extreme value analysis further reveals increasing variability in precipitation extremes for eight climatologically unique cities across the CONUS by the end of the twenty-first century and significant increases in return period precipitation amounts for most cities examined. These results provide additional guidance for stakeholders to reduce societal impacts and economic loss from daily precipitation extremes and create a more climate-resilient society.',\n",
       "   'Abstract This study uses high-resolution, convection-permitting, dynamically downscaled regional climate simulation output to assess how long-lived, convectively induced, extratropical windstorms known as derechos may change across the CONUS during the 21st century. Three 15-year epochs including a historical period (1990 – 2005), and two, separate late-21st century periods (2085 – 2100) employing intermediate (RCP 4.5) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas concentration scenarios are evaluated. A mesoscale convective system (MCS) identification and tracking tool catalogs derecho candidates across epochs using simulated radar reflectivity and maximum 10-meter wind speed as a proxy for near-surface severe wind gusts. Results indicate that MCS-based windstorms, including derechos, are more frequent, widespread, and intense in both future climate scenarios examined for most regions of the central and eastern CONUS. Increases are suggested across all parts of the year, with significant changes in populations concentrated during the early spring and summer months, suggesting the potential for a longer, more extreme MCS windstorm season. This research provides insights for forecasters, emergency managers, and wind-vulnerable stakeholders on how these events may change across the 21 st century so that they may mitigate, adapt to, and become resilient against severe convective storm perils.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Changes in the frequency and intensity of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are assessed using convection-permitting regional climate model simulations. We present a novel classification method that relates MCSs to the magnitude of their large-scale forcing environments to better understand the changing nature of MCSs across different forcing environments in a possible future climate scenario. Overall, the annual frequency, intensity, and amount of precipitation associated with MCSs are projected to increase for broad portions of the eastern conterminous United States (CONUS). Furthermore, changes in the characteristics of MCSs show larger, longer-lived, and faster MCSs particularly over the Midwest and Southeast. Seasonal examination of this response reveals a robust intensification of March–May (MAM) MCSs. The higher frequency of MAM MCSs are found to occur in weakly forced synoptic environments. Increased rainfall amounts are explained by an intensification of MCSs due to changing thermodynamics and enhanced lower-tropospheric moisture transport into the central CONUS by the North Atlantic Subtropical High. Differences in mid-latitude storm tracks are favorable towards the enhanced development of MCSs associated with strong baroclinic forcing within the Midwest and Northern Plains, but are only realized in the presence of strong changes in lower-tropospheric moisture transport. Overall, these results suggest a shift in the behavior of MAM MCSs that more closely corresponds to the behavior of June–August (JJA) MCSs in the historical climate. The increased occurrence of MCSs in weakly forced environments, particularly in MAM, deserves further investigation.'],\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Context Many college students struggle with food insecurity due to limited income and competing financial interests for tuition and housing. Students in health care professions may be at an even higher risk of food insecurity; for instance, researchers have indicated that over 50% of nursing students experience food insecurity. However, little is known about the frequency and attributing factors to food insecurity in professional athletic training students. Objective To investigate the frequency and attributing factors of food insecurity experienced by professional athletic training students. Design Cross-sectional study. Patients or Other Participants One hundred sixteen participants completed the survey (11.6% completion rate). Twenty-four were males, and 92 were females. Main Outcome Measure(s) Participants received an e-mail with a link to the online survey by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association Research Survey Services. Participants completed the US Household Food Security Survey Module: Six-Item Short Form to identify food insecurity frequency, along with demographic questions and questions about dietary habits, academic demands, and mental health to identify factors that may contribute to food insecurity. We used a series of χ2 tests to determine if any significant group differences existed between food security groups and the personal and demographic questions. Results One hundred sixteen participants completed the survey; 35.3% reported having high or marginal food security, 37.1% reported low food security, and 27.6% reported very low food security. We found that participants with high to marginal food security were more likely to live with family or a spouse. Conclusions Over 60% of professional athletic training students reported low to very low food security. Professional athletic training programs should be aware of this risk and create policies to help ease the challenges to food security among their students.',\n",
       "   'Locomotor adaptation is a motor learning process used to alter spatiotemporal elements of walking that are driven by prediction errors, a discrepancy between the expected and actual outcomes of our actions. Sensory and reward prediction errors are two different types of prediction errors that can facilitate locomotor adaptation. Reward and punishment feedback generate reward prediction errors but have demonstrated mixed effects on upper extremity motor learning, with punishment enhancing adaptation, and reward supporting motor memory. However, an in-depth behavioral analysis of these distinct forms of feedback is sparse in locomotor tasks.'],\n",

A total of 293 pre-service teachers completed Fitzsimmons-Doolan's 2011 language ideology dimensions survey at the beginning of an academic semester. At the end of the term candidates responded to three open-ended questions, and responses were analysed and categorised into three themes: what candidates need to know, what EBs' academic needs are, and what a culturally relevant teacher preparation curriculum must offer. Findings suggest participants' visions of schooling seemed to change after completing two or more BEM courses, and after reaching a 21–30 clinical hour scaffold working in an instructional capacity with EBs in K-12 schools.\",\n",
       "   \"The integration of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) into educational settings has gained significant attention due to its positive correlation with student academic achievement and long-term success. While extensively studied in developed nations, empirical evidence regarding SEL implementation in Latin America (LA) remains limited. Uruguay, one of the few countries in LA integrating SEL into educational curricula, aims to bolster SEL practises to improve student outcomes. However, there is prevailing concern among Uruguayan teachers regarding the need for adequate training to effectively implement SEL. This qualitative study investigates the efforts of Uruguayan English as a Foreign Language (EFL) elementary teachers to embed SEL within their instruction. Following a three-week online SEL course, 22 teachers were observed using the SEL Coaching Toolkit. Findings revealed teachers' commitment to integrate SEL, yet inconsistencies and limited explicit SEL practises were observed. The study highlights a need for enhanced SEL training and support for educators. Recommendations include providing foundational SEL knowledge, fostering collaborative learning environments, and empowering educators to effectively nurture students’ social emotional competencies, thereby advocating for equitable educational opportunities and fostering positive learning outcomes. Keywords: Social emotional learning, professional development, teacher training, SEL practises, English as a Foreign Language.\",\n",
       "   'This qualitative case study examined 11 teaching assistants’ (TAs) awareness of the need to infuse culturally responsive pedagogy into undergraduate level courses. The TAs represented the fields of political science, history, English, psychology, world languages, and kinesiology at one public university. One-on-one interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed utilizing six phase thematic analysis. Interactive analysis and coding provided a system to examine the data, generate initial codes, and subsequently review, define, and report on the themes that emerged. Results suggest the TAs interviewed had not been adequately prepared to infuse culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP) with instruction.',\n",

       "   'The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the schooling processes in K-12 systems. Principals navigated many challenges both during remote online learning and after returning to in-person education. This study explored the processes that 11 charter high school principals experienced during the pandemic. Using thematic analysis of interview data from 11 school principals, researchers aimed to understand how urban school principals’ perceptions towards online education practices in underprivileged communities have changed towards both online learning and schooling in general during the covid-19 pandemic. The goal of this examination is to then make recommendations for systemic reform. Five themes emerged: 1) school principals’ differing experiences with online learning during the pandemic, 2) challenges and opportunities in transitioning to online learning during the pandemic, 3) equity problems, 4) perspectives of school principals on online learning during the pandemic, and 5) shifts in school principals’ perceptions of online learning. Findings suggest important implications for principals, district leaders, policymakers, and researchers.',\n",
       "   'This qualitative case study examined teachers’ views on integrating Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and its role in supporting Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP). A total of 32 K-5th grade English as a Foreign Language (EFL) Uruguayan teachers completed a three-week online asynchronous professional development. Participants’ training focused on SEL principles, practices, and strategies for the English as a foreign language classroom. During the training, a three-scale rubric (0 - 3 points) served to formatively assess and provide feedback to the participants on completing weekly tasks. The evaluation examined the content of the teachers’ reflection and applications to practice. Feedback focused on how well teachers grasped the theoretical content and its integration. Once the training was completed, participants answered four open-ended questions in an online repository questionnaire. Findings document that after the intervention, the teachers perceived that students benefitted from learning about SEL and its implementation, and they came to believe that SEL principles need to become an integral part of instructional planning in Uruguay’s EFL classrooms.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"The flipped classroom is an innovative pedagogy that shifts content delivery outside the classroom, utilizing in-class time for interactive learning. The preclass and in-class activities in this framework encourage individualized learning and collaborative problem-solving among students, fostering engagement. The Innovative Flipped Learning Instruction Project (IFLIP) conducted faculty development workshops over 4 years, guiding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty in integrating flipped teaching (FT) into their courses. The research aimed to assess its impact on pedagogical practices, explore its effectiveness, and provide a framework to implement FT across multiple institutions. It sought to evaluate the experiences of these educators throughout the transitional period of instructional change. In the fourth year of this project, a symposium was organized for IFLIP participants to share their experiences and findings concerning FT. This symposium helped promote collaboration among IFLIP participants and faculty interested in FT to disseminate participants' knowledge and experiences in implementing FT strategies. A survey conducted at the end of the symposium indicated that faculty participants with FT experience continued to embrace this pedagogy, and the new adopters expressed intentions to incorporate it into their courses. The survey revealed positive responses: 93% of respondents plan to integrate FT methods in future classes, 90% gained new information from the symposium and intend to implement it, and 91% are likely to recommend FT to colleagues. Ultimately, the symposium underscored the transformative impact of FT in empowering educators to deepen students' conceptual understanding, emphasizing the significance of this pedagogical approach in advancing the quality of education.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['In this work, we investigate the existence of multistationarity for a triple-site mixed phosphorylation network, where the phosphorylation part contains distributive and processive components, while the dephosphorylation part is purely distributive. We obtain a simple inequality which defines a region in parameter space such that the parametric ordinary differential equations (ODE) system modeling the mixed network is multistationary, i.e., it has multiple positive steady states. We obtain a sufficient condition for uniqueness of the steady state in the form of parametric inequalities. Lastly, we show that the emergence of multistationarity is enabled by the catalytic constants regardless of the position of the processive part in the triple-site mixed mechanism phosphorylation network.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Ordered distributive double phosphorylation is a recurrent motif in intracellular signaling and control. It is either sequential (where the site phosphorylated last is dephosphorylated first) or cyclic (where the site phosphorylated first is dephosphorylated first). Sequential distributive double phosphorylation has been extensively studied and an inequality involving only the catalytic constants of kinase and phosphatase is known to be sufficient for multistationarity. As multistationarity is necessary for bistability it has been argued that these constants enable bistability. Here we show for cyclic distributive double phosphorylation that if its catalytic constants satisfy an analogous inequality, then Hopf bifurcations and hence sustained oscillations can occur. Hence we argue that in distributive double phosphorylation (sequential or distributive) the catalytic constants enable non-trivial dynamics. In fact, if the rate constant values in a network of cyclic distributive double phosphorylation satisfy this inequality, then a network of sequential distributive double phosphorylation with the same rate constant values will show multistationarity—albeit for different values of the total concentrations. For cyclic distributive double phosphorylation we further describe a procedure to generate rate constant values where Hopf bifurcations and hence sustained oscillations can occur. This may, for example, allow for an efficient sampling of oscillatory regions in parameter space. Our analysis is greatly simplified by the fact that it is possible to reduce the network of cyclic distributive double phosphorylation to what we call a network with a single extreme ray. We summarize key properties of these networks.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Purpose District-university partners increasingly rely on “grow-your-own” licensure programs to address teacher shortages. Because vacancies in special education represent a chronic issue, our district-university partnership developed LEAP – the Licensed Educators’ Accelerated Pathway, successfully preparing 26 paraprofessionals as special education teachers (SEs). We describe a model university-district partnership in which we collaborated to design and implement paraprofessionals’ SE licensure program. Design/methodology/approach In this general review, we describe a district-university partnership collaboration that resolved barriers experienced by paraprofessionals working toward licensure in special education (Essential #4, Reflection and Innovation). The specialized design and partnership solutions were grounded in SE preparation research literature. Findings 25 (28 entered the program and 25 completed) paraprofessionals from one large urban and several regional districts completed special education licensure through LEAP. Slightly more than half of LEAP participants were Black or Hispanic (see Table 1), contributing to the diversification of SE workforce. University-district partnership was successful in designing and delivering a program that allowed participants: a) to remain employed, b) attend evening classes in their geographic region or online, c) complete all field experiences in sponsoring districts (Essential #2) and d) receive concierge advising from a “completion coach.” We describe solutions to barriers experienced by paraprofessionals and advocate for district-university collaboration to address chronic teacher shortages. Research limitations/implications Limitations include lack of data on success of program completers during their first year of teaching as they began this work in Fall 2023. Further, because the participating district was large and urban, generalization of program details for small and rural districts is difficult. Practical implications Practical tips for developing grow-your-own special education licensure programs are providing. Detailed descriptions of barriers candidates experienced and ways the district-university partners resolved these issues are included. Programs like the one described has the potential to positively impact teacher pipeline issues. Social implications The program described provided highly-trained teachers to fill chronic vacancies in special education in three participating districts/agencies. Because students receiving special education services are at risk for school failure and are disproportionately impacted by teacher turnover, addressing this area through grow-your-own licensure programs represents a diversity, equity and inclusion initiative. Further, upskilling diverse paraprofessionals to licensed teacher roles represent an economic boost, which they might not otherwise have achieved. Originality/value Available research literature signals alarm over persistent teacher shortages in hard-to-staff districts and lack of diversity in the teacher workforce, but few published accounts describe successful programs. Partner collaboration fostered a re-imagining of course formatting and delivery to accommodate adult learners, avoiding problems often reported with alternative programs.'],\n",

Ratios (teacher:student) of 5:4, 4:4, 3:4, and 2:4, involving the teacher, paraprofessionals, and four junior high students with autism were measured. Using momentary time sampling, environment, organization, student, and staff activity data were collected. Higher ratios correlated with increased student engagement and fewer behavioral interventions, while lower ratios led to decreased staff–student interactions and more behavioral interventions. • Authors discussed the impacts of teacher–student ratios in educational settings for children with autism. • State guidelines need revision to be sensitive to classroom composition. • Researchers have focused on academic outcomes and teacher perceptions. • Momentary time sampling is a practical approach for clinicians to use when objectively assessing variables in the classroom setting.',\n",
       "   'Purpose: Individuals from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) are often offered English-only AAC systems that do not meet their language needs. The aim of this review article was to describe the research published on multilingual AAC, define any emerging best practices, and highlight gaps in the literature that exist to ensure equal language access for all learners. Method: The authors reviewed the literature by searching relevant databases using a variety of search terms. Following our inclusionary and exclusionary criteria, 15 articles were yielded for coding and then patterns were reported. Results: The authors found that more than half of the included articles were expert opinion papers on AAC delivery, barriers to AAC and multilingualism, and code-switching using AAC. The included qualitative studies aimed to summarize the perceptions on AAC services—their impact, facilitating and limiting factors in communication, and the importance or relevance of using an AAC device. Only two quantitative studies were included. Conclusions: Practitioners have an obligation to support multilingual clients who use AAC across all languages they speak at school, at home, and in the community. Much of the literature supports encouraging multiple languages, but limited access to multilingual AAC systems are available. There is also a dire need for empirically based studies and more perspectives by way of interviews or surveys.',\n",

       "   'Abstract Improving social communication and reducing challenging forms of restricted and repetitive behaviors (i.e., stereotypy) are often the focus of behavioral interventions for individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities. Interventions incorporating augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems are utilized to improve independent communication. However, using electronic AAC devices (e.g., iPads) may increase stereotypic behaviors (i.e., pressing the same icon on an AAC device two or more times within 2 s), which may impact the development and maintenance of communication skills. There is a shortage of research focusing on AAC‐related stereotypy, with only one study that includes a systematic assessment and treatment evaluation (Cook et al., 2017). The purpose of the current investigation was to conduct a functional analysis screening procedure that only included play and no‐interaction conditions to adequately assess the function of AAC‐related stereotypy. We sought to ask, how client‐specific modifications to functional assessment procedures affect the outcomes of functional assessments of AAC‐related stereotypy. Initial findings suggest that AAC‐related stereotypy is often automatically reinforced, but its occurrence can be sensitive to the presence/absence of specific environmental stimuli.',\n",

       "   \"Abstract Ageing and chronic stress have been linked to reduced telomere length (TL) in mixed‐age groups. Whether stress response components are linked to TL during the midlife‐to‐late adulthood transition remains unclear. Our study aimed to synthesise evidence on the relationship between psychological and biological components of stress response on TL in middle‐aged and older adults. We conducted a systematic review of studies obtained from six databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus) and evaluated by two independent reviewers. Original research measuring psychological and biological components of stress response and TL in human individuals were included. From an initial pool of 614 studies, 15 were included ( n = 9446 participants). Synthesis of evidence showed that higher psychological components of the stress response (i.e., global perceived stress or within a specific life domain and cognitive appraisal to social‐evaluative stressors) were linked to shorter TL, specifically in women or under major life stressors. For the biological stress response, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and IGF‐1/cortisol imbalance, IL‐6, MCP‐1, blood pressure, and heart rate presented a significant association with TL, but this relationship depended on major life stressors and the stress context (manipulated vs. non‐manipulated conditions). This comprehensive review showed that psychological and biological components of the stress response are linked to shorter TL, but mainly in women or those under a major life stressor and stress‐induced conditions. The interaction between stressor attributes and psychological and biological reactions in the transition from middle to late adulthood still needs to be fully understood, and examining it is a critical step to expanding our understanding of stress's impact on ageing trajectories.\",\n",

However, there has been little community-level analysis of the relationship between homelessness and crime rates. In this study, we discuss the criminogenic consequences of homelessness and then use panel data from 261 municipalities over a 21-year period (2000–2020) in Finland to examine how homelessness is related to different types of criminal offenses. Results from random and fixed-effects equations indicate that, net of common covariates, rates of homelessness are associated with increased rates of violent crime, property crime, and public intoxication offenses. The findings suggest that, in addition to mental health treatment, efforts to reduce homelessness enhance community safety.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Housing instability is associated with numerous poor child outcomes in domains such as behavioral and emotional problems. The impacts of housing instability on child outcomes are typically investigated in the context of sociodemographic risk; however, exploring the role of protective factors (e.g., family routines, parental warmth) in these contexts allows for a more thorough understanding of the effect of housing instability and how potential negative outcomes might be mitigated. The present study further explored the relation between early housing instability and child behavioral and emotional outcomes in middle childhood in addition to the potential moderating role of family routines and parental warmth in early childhood. Longitudinal data of 4,898 families from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study were used to explore these associations. Using structural equation modeling, the present analyses indicated that when controlling for key sociodemographic covariates, housing instability in early childhood was not related to child outcomes at age 9. Greater parental warmth at age 5 was significantly associated with lower levels of behavioral and emotional problems at age 9. Categorical models using the product indicator approach indicated that greater parental warmth attenuates the relation between moving one to two times and later child behavioral problems. Parental warmth emerged as a significant promotive factor for later child emotional problems. Further implications are discussed below.

To ensure the tools were measuring what they were intended to, and that they were reliable, the authors enlisted content experts, including a librarian with academic engagement expertise, three educational psychologists with specialization in college students' engagement, self-regulation, and related fields, and two psychometricians with knowledge of psychological measurement. The authors also reflect on the lessons they learned from the process of developing and validating the assessment tools.\",\n",
       "   \"Academic library collections have traditionally prioritized and valued white voices, resulting in a lack of representation of authors who have marginalized racial, ethnic, and gender identities. Diversity audits can make the whiteness of collections visible and inform collection development practices that prioritize the work of marginalized scholars to make libraries more inclusive spaces for patrons, workers, students, and scholars. In a diversity audit of author racial, ethnic, and gender identities in an academic library's journalism monograph collection, the results show that the collection overwhelmingly reflects authors who are white men. Collection development librarians can increase the diversity of authors in their collections by creating a protocol for identifying, purchasing, and marketing works by marginalized authors.\",\n",

What is it for a speaker who performs an illocutionary act to have deniability regarding that act? I first review an answer to this question proposed by Alexander Dinges and Julia Zakkou. According to them, deniability is “an epistemic notion. A speaker has deniability if she can make it epistemically irrational for her audience to reason in certain ways” (2023, p. 373). I argue, however, that the epistemic account is refuted by a counterexample, and informed by the counterexample, I propose an alternative. According to my alternative account, deniability concerns illocutionary norms: a speaker has deniability regarding an illocutionary action iff (i) she is permitted to deny having performed the action, and (ii) if she denies having performed the action, she thereby avoids being responsible for it. I conclude by considering the implications of illocutionary norms account of deniability for the vexed issue of the determinants of illocutionary force; I argue that the illocutionary norms account of deniability provides evidence in support of McDonald’s (2021) “collaboration” view.',\n",

This knowledge has influenced the development of therapeutic nature-based programs across disciplines; however, limited literature explores these practices, especially for elementary-aged children. This study conducted focus group interviews with practitioners to gather rich data on the essential components of therapeutic nature-based programs. Results from the data support using therapeutic nature-based programs to help children develop their orientation to others and the environment, sense of self, self-regulation, and sensory integration skills. The study provides specific examples of a facilitation style and materials. Future assessments looking at the effectiveness of therapeutic nature-based programming on the development of particular skills will further validate these findings.'],\n",

Unlike student outcomes, the leadership environment that produces the results is rarely examined for its merit and impact. In this study, a quantitative survey gathered information to investigate the impacts of leadership capacity constructs on academic achievement. Principals from 161 public high schools and their schools provided the data (leadership capacity, demographics, and reading and math scores). Data were analyzed using descriptive, correlational, and regression statistics. Findings indicated significant high correlations among leadership capacity variables, significant relationships between school demographics (total school enrollment, percentage of low-income students, average class size, and attendance) and reading and math scores, and non-significant correlations between leadership capacity and academic achievement. The study delineated specific leadership capacity behaviors within the constructs that predicted student academic achievement in math and reading. The study suggests increased capacity and practice of these leadership behaviors to improve work setting and student achievement.&lt;/p&gt;'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Introduction Aspergillus flavus is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus that infects oilseed crops worldwide. When colonizing plants, it produces mycotoxins, including carcinogenic compounds such as aflatoxins. Mycotoxin contamination results in an important economic and health impact. The design of new strategies to control A. flavus colonization and mycotoxin contamination is paramount. Methods The biocontrol potential of a promising new isolate of Pseudomonas spp., 20EI1 against A. flavus was assessed using bioassays and microscopy. To further elucidate the nature of this bacterial-fungal interaction, we also performed chemical and transcriptomics analyses. Results In the present study, Pseudomonas spp., 20EI1 was able to reduce the growth of A. flavus . Furthermore, we determined that this growth inhibition is iron-dependent. In addition, Pseudomonas 20EI1 reduced or blocked the production of aflatoxin, as well as cyclopiazonic acid and kojic acid. Expression of iron-related genes was altered in the presence of the bacteria and genes involved in the production of aflatoxin were down-regulated. Iron supplementation partially reestablished their expression. Expression of other secondary metabolite (SM) genes was also reduced by the bacteria, including genes of clusters involved in cyclopiazonic acid, kojic acid and imizoquin biosynthesis, while genes of the cluster corresponding to aspergillicin, a siderophore, were upregulated. Interestingly, the global SM regulatory gene mtfA was significantly upregulated by 20EI1, which could have contributed to the observed alterations in SM. Discussion Our results suggest that Pseudomonas 20EI1 is a promising biocontrol against A. flavus , and provide further insight into this iron-dependent bacterial-fungal interaction affecting the expression of numerous genes, among them those involved in SM.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The pathophysiological and psychosocial factors influencing athletes with disabilities are crucial to their sports performance and well-being. This systematic review aims to provide evidence-based insights into how these factors should be adopted into coaching practice. The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar was conducted, and studies were selected based on clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty-six studies met these criteria and were included in the thematic analysis. In the pathophysiological domain, effective coaching requires adaptive training programs tailored to address the specific physical and physiological challenges of athletes with disabilities. These strategies include injury prevention, performance optimization, and management of muscle imbalance and altered musculoskeletal biomechanics. The psychosocial domain emphasizes the importance of emotional support, resilience-building, and social inclusion, with coaches playing a key role in helping athletes navigate challenges such as social stigma, emotional stress, and reduced self-confidence. This review underscores the necessity of a comprehensive coaching approach that integrates both pathophysiological and psychosocial considerations, enabling coaches to address the complex needs of athletes with disabilities. Synthesized findings provide actionable recommendations for individualized coaching strategies. These insights have significant implications for advancing coaching practices and promoting inclusivity in sports environments for all athletes.',\n",
       "   'Background: The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the findings of texture analyses of musculoskeletal ultrasound images and synthesize the information to facilitate the use of texture analysis on assessing skeletal muscle quality in various pathophysiological conditions. Methods: Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched from their inception until January 2025 using the PRISMA Diagnostic Test Accuracy and was registered at PROSPERO CRD42025636613. Information related to patients, interventions, ultrasound settings, texture analyses, muscles, and findings were extracted. The quality of evidence was evaluated using QUADAS-2. Results: A total of 38 studies using second-order and higher-order texture analysis met the criteria. The results indicated that no studies used an established reference standard (histopathology) to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound texture analysis in diagnosing muscle quality. Alternative reference standards were compared, including various physiological, pathological, and pre–post intervention comparisons using over 200+ texture features of various muscles on diverse pathophysiological conditions. Conclusions: The findings of these included studies demonstrating that ultrasound texture analysis was able to discriminate changes in muscle quality using texture analysis between patients with pathological conditions and healthy conditions, including popular gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based contrast, correlation, energy, entropy, and homogeneity. Studies also demonstrated that texture analysis can discriminate muscle quality in various muscles under pathophysiological conditions although evidence is low because of bias in subject recruitment and lack of comparison with the established reference standard. This is the first systematic review of the use of texture analysis of musculoskeletal ultrasonography in assessing muscle quality in various muscles under diverse pathophysiological conditions.',\n",
       "   \"Parents of individuals with autism face many challenges in finding appropriate services and support for their children, and they also play an important role in advocating for their children's rights and needs. Despite the increasing availability of advocacy programs, it is still uncertain how to best encourage parents to advocate for their children. This study explored the connection between parents' knowledge and sense of empowerment, and how these factors relate to three types of advocacy activities (i.e. individual, peer, and systemic). The findings reveal that feeling empowered has a greater impact on advocacy than simply having knowledge. In addition, the study found that individual advocacy correlates to more peer advocacy, which also correlates to more systemic advocacy. These results can help researchers and professionals to better develop programs to increase parent advocacy and, in turn, help improve the lives of individuals with autism.\",\n",
       "   \"Although advocacy seems inevitable for families of individuals with disabilities across the lifespan, little is known about how advocacy may change from early intervention to school services. By understanding similarities and differences across the time periods, we can develop interventions to improve advocacy during early intervention and school services, respectively. We conducted interviews with 14 caregivers of individuals with disabilities comparing their lived experiences with advocacy during early intervention and school services. Participants reported conducting case advocacy (i.e. advocacy for one individual such as one's child) and cause advocacy (i.e. advocacy for a group of individuals such as all children with disabilities) during early intervention and school services. They also reported the same advocacy strategies for each time period and many of the same barriers to advocacy. Only two barriers differed; in early intervention, participants reported lacking peer support and in school services, participants reported struggling with jargon. For early intervention and school services, participants reported that advocacy yielded positive outcomes for their children with disabilities. However, it often took a year to yield a positive outcome. There were mixed perceptions about whether case or cause advocacy was easier for families. Implications for research and practice are discussed.\",\n",

Our specific aims were to explore feedback from an advisory board about the app and to explore feedback from navigators about the app. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> Via a multistage codevelopment process, we elicited feedback from 5 key parties: the research team, a community organization, the app development team, the advisory board, and family navigators. Collectively, 36 individuals provided feedback about the development of the app via individual interviews, focus groups, observations, and surveys. The key features of the app included a dashboard showing the service needs of the family and related resources, a messaging feature between the family, the navigator, and the supervisor, and a fidelity checklist and evaluation feature. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> The advisory board provided feedback about the app to increase its user-friendliness, include the ability to develop an action plan, improve the identification of needed services, and add information about service providers. Navigators suggested that the app should connect navigators to one another, have a clearer purpose for the notes section, and reflect an easier log-in process. Navigators also wanted training to role-play using the app. After participating in a role play using the app, navigators reported significantly more satisfaction with the app and greater usefulness (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;.001). </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> Our work sheds light on the importance of eliciting feedback from end users, especially users who are often overlooked by the research community and app developers.

       "   \"Many children with autism could benefit from adult support during motor play. The purpose of this study was to explore parents' perspectives on the importance of structured motor activities and how they might support the motor development of their young children with autism. Interviews were conducted with six parents of preschoolers with autism to understand their perceptions about structured motor play. Results revealed that parents: (a) valued structured motor activities, but many did not implement them at home; (b) had limited knowledge about motor development; (c) were uncertain about how to find motor resources; and (d) would like teachers to lead structured motor activities at school and send home ideas for parents to build on these activities. The findings provide insights about partnering with parents to support motor development, ideas for curriculum development, and suggestions for professional development for teachers. Implications for research and practice are discussed.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Parent advocacy is often critical for families of individuals with disabilities. Prior research has suggested that parent advocacy occurs across three levels: individual, peer, and systemic. Yet, little empirical research has identified the correlates of advocacy for each level. For this study, we examined the survey responses of 246 parents of individuals with disabilities who were interested in participating in a legislative advocacy program. Analyses included hierarchical regressions to identify the correlates of individual, peer, and systemic advocacy. Parents of children with autism were significantly more likely to engage in individual advocacy. Parents who identified as Black (versus other racial groups) advocated significantly more on a systemic level. Further, malleable factors such as empowerment and motivation correlated positively with advocacy. Implications for research and practice are discussed.',\n",
       "   \"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools were required to shift to virtual learning. Parents and students had to adapt to this sudden change in learning environments and many of their home lives also changed dramatically. Some families faced additional challenges in accessing virtual learning and in balancing their daily lives. The purpose of this study was to explore parent perceptions of virtual learning. Interviews were conducted with 20 parents of students who attended middle or high schools in underserved areas in one Midwestern US state in the summer of 2021. The majority of participants were between 36-45 years of age, and most participants identified as White (55% or n = 11), with 30% identifying as Black. Additionally, the majority of participants reported having a college degree (55%, n = 11). Nineteen parent participants were female (95%). Constant comparative analysis and emergent coding were used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that virtual learning impacted participants' daily routines, with participants sharing positive and negative aspects of their stress levels and their children's academic performance. Some parents reported less stress due to the flexibility afforded through virtual learning, whereas other parents noted an increase in their stress level as a result of having to assume extra responsibility for their children's school work. In addition, the majority of parents reported that virtual learning negatively impacted their children's mental health. Some parents of students with disabilities reported that their children had positive experiences with virtual learning. Implications for research and practice are discussed.\",\n",

       "   \"ABSTRACT Background To investigate the feasibility of conducting COVID‐19 testing in kindergarten‐grade 12 schools, saliva‐based testing was implemented in five schools. The purpose of this study was to understand staff's perspectives of the barriers and facilitators to conducting saliva‐based testing in their settings. Methods Thirty‐three school staff who worked in five target schools were interviewed in the summer of 2021. Participants were recruited from June–August 2021 via a flyer that was distributed through email and school‐affiliated social media and websites, and word‐of‐mouth. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted over Zoom by a trained interviewer; interviews were audio recorded and auto transcribed using this Zoom feature. Constant comparative analysis and emergent coding were used to analyze the data. Results The majority of participants had positive experiences with conducting saliva‐based testing during school hours. Participants reported that saliva‐based testing did not interrupt their school routine because (1) the testing was simple and quick, (2) the testing schedule was consistent and organized, and (3) school staff maintained open lines of communication. Barriers to implementing the testing were as follows: (1) obtaining parental consent, (2) not being allowed to drink or eat an hour before testing, and (3) struggling to provide enough saliva for testing. Participants suggested the following strategies to facilitate testing in schools: being more proactive, giving families fewer things to sign (i.e., consent forms), improving communication, adding needed consents to the school registration process, using social media, and increasing community outreach. Conclusion As schools weigh the benefits and the risks of closing for extended periods of time versus remaining open for in‐person learning, saliva‐based testing is a feasible and efficient way to support programs in this decision‐making process. This approach can be used in future pandemics and in areas with outbreaks or poor vaccine coverage.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract Although services are critical for many transition-aged youth, it is unclear the extent to which autistic youth participate in decisions about their services. By exploring the perceptions of autistic youth about their role in services, interventions can be developed to improve their participation. In this study, we interviewed 43 transition-aged youth with autism to explore their involvement in decisions about services. Most youth reported not being involved in decision making about the types and modalities of disability services. When youth were involved in decisions, the services were often related to education. Although youth reported that their parents typically spearheaded decisions about services, youth also reported that their parents often listened to their input.

       "   'While there are opportunities for families to fulfill leadership roles in early intervention, families often report feeling disempowered and unprepared to become leaders. To this end, in this pilot study, we evaluated the effectiveness and feasibility of an 8-hour leadership program for 20 parents of children who are receiving, or recently received, early intervention services. Participants demonstrated significant increases in early intervention knowledge and empowerment after completing the leadership program. The program had high attendance, low attrition, and high fidelity to the curriculum. Participants were overwhelmingly satisfied with the program and suggested a longer program duration. Initial efficacy and participant enthusiasm suggest a need to consider program implementation more broadly with the goal of increasing parent leadership and involvement in early intervention.',\n",
       "   'In the last reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), families of individuals with disabilities provided less than 4% of the public comments. Given that families are equal partners in the decision-making process for students with disabilities, it is critical to understand their suggestions for IDEA. To this end, we analyzed the testimonials of 65 families of individuals with disabilities. Specifically, after completing a civic engagement program, participants provided video, audio, and/or written testimonials focused on their suggestions for the next IDEA reauthorization. Participants suggested strengthening existing IDEA provisions, increasing federal funding of special education, addressing personnel issues in special education, improving accountability, and increasing family knowledge and empowerment. Participants’ suggestions were further analyzed by examining patterns within the data; families of children with (vs. without) autism were significantly more likely to request that the next IDEA reauthorization increases knowledge and empowerment.

       "   \"Abstract Structured motor play is crucial to the motor and social development of children with disabilities. However, many teachers report that including children with disabilities in motor play is challenging, especially during virtual learning. The purpose of this interview study was to explore 26 preschool teachers' perspectives on engaging children with disabilities in motor play in virtual environments and the strategies they used to involve students. Teachers believed that including children with disabilities in virtual motor play activities is important for their physical development, sense of belonging, and exploration of potential. Teachers also indicated that understanding the motor abilities and interests of children with disabilities and making adaptations to support each child during virtual motor play is important. Additionally, seeing therapists as resources for motor play ideas and sharing resources with parents were strategies suggested by participants to facilitate the engagement of children with disabilities in motor play during virtual learning. Findings suggest that an interdisciplinary approach to teaching motor play is crucial for children with disabilities regardless of the service delivery model.\"],\n",

While approaches that aim to study local cultures of AI are important, there is the risk of neglecting their insertion within the broader geographies and politics of AI. As a response to this challenge, this article proposes a pathway to apply the concept of power geometries, originally proposed by feminist geographer Doreen Massey, to the case of AI. Reframing the global dimension of AI in terms of power geometries helps locate these positions in the complex networks of relationships between different actors at the global level. The power geometries of AI follow the lines and inequalities of the relationships between Global North and Global South, between colonizers and colonized, but also between diverse actors at different scales, such as governments, policymakers, corporations, designers, workers, and users. While all media can be examined in terms of power geometries, the power geometries of AI bring the issue of agency to the central stage. The reconfiguration of the question of agency sparked by AI, in fact, has generated new kinds of structures and trajectories underpinning AI’s power geometries.',\n",
       "   'As research fields, mediatization and Human-Machine Communication (HMC) have distinct historical trajectories. While mediatization research is concerned with the fundamental interrelation between the transformation of media and communications and cultural and societal changes, the much younger field of HMC delves into human meaning-making in interactions with machines. However, the recent wave of “deep mediatization,” characterized by an increasing emphasis on general communicative automation and the rise of communicative AI, highlights a shared interest in technology’s role within human interaction. This introductory article examines the trajectories of both fields, demonstrating how mediatization research “zooms out” from overarching questions of societal and cultural transformations, while HMC tends to “zoom in” to approach the concrete situatedness of the interaction between humans and machines. It is argued that we need to combine both perspectives to better understand how the automation of communication transforms the social construction of culture and society. This article offers an overview of the key themes explored in this thematic issue, highlighting the productive intersection of HMC and mediatization within each article. Additionally, it identifies potential avenues for future research emerging from this fruitful intersection.',\n",
       "   \"How should scholars make sense of the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence in media work? In this commentary, we argue that researchers can begin by stepping outside of their intellectual silos to see how the challenges and opportunities posed by generative AI are commonly shared across the media industries. We focus on three primary mass communication domains—advertising, journalism, and public relations—to illustrate how media professionals across these fields are adopting similar AI technologies (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing, and recommender systems) for often similar purposes (e.g., content creation, audience engagement, and business operations). Even more, the uptake of AI has profound consequences—for ethical norms as well as roles and relationships of humans and machines—that may be best understood across media industries more so than within them in isolation. Ultimately, a more cross-industry approach to scholarship could develop a more encompassing picture about AI's impact on media work and media consumption.\",\n",
       "   'As research fields, mediatization and Human-Machine Communication (HMC) have distinct historical trajectories.While mediatization research is concerned with the fundamental interrelation between the transformation of media and communications and cultural and societal changes, the much younger field of HMC delves into human meaning-making in interactions with machines.However, the recent wave of \"deep mediatization, \" characterized by an increasing emphasis on general communicative automation and the rise of communicative AI, highlights a shared interest in technology\\'s role within human interaction.This introductory article examines the trajectories of both fields, demonstrating how mediatization research \"zooms out\" from overarching questions of societal and cultural transformations, while HMC tends to \"zoom in\" to approach the concrete situatedness of the interaction between humans and machines.It is argued that we need to combine both perspectives to better understand how the automation of communication transforms the social construction of culture and society.This article offers an overview of the key themes explored in this thematic issue, highlighting the productive intersection of HMC and mediatization within each article.Additionally, it identifies potential avenues for future research emerging from this fruitful intersection.',\n",
       "   'Unlike other data modalities such as text and vision, speech does not lend itself to easy interpretation. While lay people can understand how to describe an image or sentence via perception, non-expert descriptions of speech often end at high-level demographic information, such as gender or age. In this paper, we propose a possible interpretable representation of speaker identity based on perceptual voice qualities (PQs). By adding gendered PQs to the pathology-focused Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) protocol, our PQ-based approach provides a perceptual latent space of the character of adult voices that is an intermediary of abstraction between high-level demographics and low-level acoustic, physical, or learned representations. Contrary to prior belief, we demonstrate that these PQs are hearable by ensembles of non-experts, and further demonstrate that the information encoded in a PQ-based representation is predictable by various speech representations.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The geological sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (geo-STEM) have the capacity to investigate and address geological and environmental challenges. Many of these challenges (e.g., pollution, flooding, and slope failure) unjustly impact lower socio-economic communities in urban and rural settings where there is limited access to geo-STEM expertise. Geo-STEM learning ecosystems (GLEs) integrate geo-STEM and social science research paradigms to broaden civic engagement in the geosciences. GLEs are communities of practice consisting of geo-STEM professionals, educators, and learners who address local issues through place-based STEM research and education. The purpose of this study was to connect the concept of GLEs with the extant literature on learning ecosystems. We conducted a thematic review of the literature evaluating how the term \"learning ecosystem\" is used in psychology, educational technology, and STEM education research. We categorized the learning ecosystem components described in the literature in terms of inputs (e.g., motivation, software, learning environment), processes (e.g., cognition, device development, curriculum), and outputs (e.g., creativity, innovation, engagement). This approach revealed themes aligned with GLE-relevant research on communities of practice, and place-based and problem-based education, connecting GLEs to a century of existing research. To demonstrate how to use a GLE framework, we analyze the attributes of three existing programs through the GLE lens. Based on our findings, we recommend that to build GLEs geo-STEM researchers should: engage in transdisciplinary collaborations to develop local geo-STEM solutions, use the GLE framework to assess geoscience education and outreach programs, evaluate the role of place in efforts to engage diverse communities, and leverage other fields of inquiry to broaden our theoretical understanding of GLEs.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Through a consideration of selected Vietnamese American works of literary fiction over three generational periods, this chapter examines the shifting articulations of memory and remembrance forms in diasporic cultural production and lived experience. With growing spatial and temporal distance from sources of diasporic origins and experiences of exile, memory is observed to be increasingly located and produced in frameworks of sensory stillness that evoke abstraction and fragmentation. Memory and its associated experiences and imaginaries are central to cultural and literary explorations and negotiations of individual, collective and generational identities, highlighting their contingencies and limits of representation. They also reorient attention away from material public memory contests that obscure more private and sensory forms of remembrance, forgetting and longing.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"ABSTRACT This qualitative study examines how secondary teachers (6th–12th grade) navigated tensions of knowledge and practice while supporting culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students in a district with a history of not meeting federal requirements for serving English learners (ELs). Through the U.S. Department of Education's National Professional Development grant program, the teachers completed a master's degree in Educational Equity and Cultural Diversity and a Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education (CLDE) endorsement. We use a critical sociocultural perspective to explore teachers' appropriation of knowledge during the first semester‐long graduate course as they grappled with new frameworks of multilingualism and advocacy rather than monolingualism and compliance. Findings illustrate how secondary teachers negotiate tensions that arise as they navigate conflicting district demands for student language and literacy development alongside emergent visions for more culturally and linguistically responsive instruction.\"],\n",

Unlike other forms of support that depend on the actions of individuals throughout the organization, benefits can be changed through decisions at the highest level and influence employees throughout the company. Yet, the literature on benefits has been largely disjointed, resulting in theoretical ambiguity and practical questions about the role of employee benefit experiences in individual employee outcomes. To inform theory and practice, we organized the benefits literature using social exchange theory as a framework and conducted a meta-analysis on the relationships of employee benefit availability, use, and subjective evaluation with perceived organizational support, employee attitudes, and well-being.

       "   'Compared to its ubiquity, social media use remains a divisive topic in the public sector. While local governments have increasingly adopted social media to increase civic engagement, many are still hesitant. Among the many factors that may have influenced the adoption of social media in local governance, we argue that community diversity deserves more attention. This study theorizes the relationship between local governments’ use of social media and community diversity. We examine this relationship within the context of township governments, which is an understudied area of research in public administration. The results indicate that community diversity is related to an increase in social media use. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings and suggest fruitful avenues of inquiry in public administration social media research.',\n",
       "   'Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how working remotely relates to psychological distress and also how this relationship varies by gender, age and employment sector. Design/methodology/approach We examined 30 waves of longitudinal data (observations = 76,845 and respondents = 4,542) drawn from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative panel collected during the period March 2020–October 2021, and analyzed the data using a negative binomial panel model. Findings The results show that both female and male workers who worked remotely during this time period experienced psychological distress. For workers aged 30–54 and those 55 years of age or above, and those who worked for nonprofit and private organizations, remote work was strongly related to psychological distress. Alternatively, remote work had no significant effect on psychological distress among younger and government workers. Originality/value The paper contributes to both research and practice related to flexible work arrangements by delving into the influence of remote work on a key employee well-being outcome, psychological distress, which has been understudied in research on human resource practices.',\n",
       "   'Community-based nonprofits have traditionally emphasized group and developmental cultures which stress the importance of people and transformation. However, evolving institutional environments that champion competing cultures associated with professional and enterprising ideals have increasingly interpenetrated contemporary nonprofits. Drawing on the Competing Values Culture Framework (CVCF), this research explores how organizational members define the complex contemporary landscape of organizational culture in community-based nonprofits and examines the relationship between diverse organizational cultures (e.g., group, developmental, hierarchical, and rational) and perceptions of effectiveness. Results indicate that employees in community-based nonprofits view group cultures as the most characteristic of their organizations, although no organization is characterized by a single culture. In line with the CVCF, we find that each organizational culture is associated with the achievement of different measures of organizational effectiveness in community-based nonprofits. We conclude with a discussion of what this means for research and practice.'],\n",

       "   'Poor supervision has long been cited by new student affairs professionals, particularly practitioners of color, as a factor contributing to their early departures from the field. This, coupled with the hierarchical and often authoritative structures of higher education, has led to practitioners of color feeling burned out and often devalued in their positions. This article discusses the importance of liberatory supervisory practices, specifically centering the supervision of new student affairs practitioners of color, that are grounded in care, compassion, and collaboration. Using composite narratives, this article discusses scenarios taken from a larger research project and then uses a supervisory framework to promote liberatory practices. This framework includes working to fracture dominance and oppression; understanding the importance of engaging in dialogue, agency, and collaboration; supporting healing and well-being; and engaging in accountability, compassion, and self-reflection. The article includes questions to guide critical reflection on supervisory practices.'],\n",

This narrative review article is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of the literature regarding the implementation of VR in the physical therapy profession. The primary objective of this review is to provide information to clinicians about the diverse applications of VR and its potential advantages in intervening across various patient populations and diagnoses during rehabilitation therapy. Through in-depth discussions with experts and a thorough review of pertinent literature, several significant aspects of the topic were identified. Subsequently, we carried out an online search to investigate the prevalent utilization of VR systems within healthcare, both as assessment tools and for therapeutic interventions. Our examination encompassed a total of 56 articles, with supplementary references incorporated as required.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['For many decades, research studies have consistently shown that people who are visually impaired (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) are at substantially higher risk of nonfatal violent crimes than are their non-disabled peers (David et al., 1988; Gish, 1977; Pava, 1994). The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) implemented by the U.S. Department of Justice specifically defines these nonfatal violent crimes as including \"rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault\" (Harrell, 2021, p. 3). Four decades ago, Welbourne et al. (1983) reported that half of all women who were congenitally blind and participated in their study had experienced at least one incident (and often, more than one incident) of forced sexual contact. Two decades ago, it was found that three out of every four people with visual impairments have been physically assaulted in their lifetimes—a figure that was found to be 15 times greater than the figure for physical assaults among the general population (Collinsworth, 2001). Data pertaining to violent crimes against people with disabilities, including those who are visually impaired, from the most recent years are consistent with these data from the past several decades. The most recent National Crime Victimization Survey report showed that the rate of nonfatal violent crimes against people with visual impairments in the U.S. was nearly four times the rate for persons without disabilities (Harrell, 2021). Specifically, the rate of nonfatal violent crimes against people with visual impairments who were aged 12 and over was 47.6 per 1,000, compared to 12.4 per 1,000 among people without disabilities who were aged 12 and over (Harrell, 2021). Also, notably, of all the disability types measured by the National Crime Victimization Survey, those who identified as visually impaired had the second highest rate of nonfatal violent crimes, with cognitive disabilities being the only disability group that ranked higher (Harrell, 2021). Thus, nonfatal violent crimes, including \"rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault\" (Harrell, 2021, p. 3), against people who are visually impaired is a long-standing problem in dire need of attention.Pava (1994) explained several reasons for the greater incidence of physical and sexual assault against people who are visually impaired, and these reasons are still highly relevant today.Therefore, many people with visual impairments perceive themselves to be more vulnerable and at risk for physical attacks (Pava et al., 1991). These perceptions are rooted in a long history of people who are visually impaired not having adequate methods with which to protect themselves from a significantly high incidence of physical and sexual assault.This article shares methods that people with visual impairments can use to decrease their vulnerability to violent crimes. We include a brief discussion about strategies that are not recommended, and this is followed by an explanation of the environments in which these questionable strategies are intended to be implemented along with our rationale regarding their inappropriateness. We follow with our considerations regarding guide dogs, as related to the topic of personal safety. These discussions are followed by our recommendations for strategies that are low cost and require little to no training on the part of the person who is visually impaired.Commonly considered strategies for self-defense include the use of martial arts, spray irritants, and the long cane. We do not recommend these approaches for the reasons detailed below.A frequently recommended strategy for personal safety among people who are visually impaired is to become an expert in a martial art. We do not recommend that approach for several reasons. First, it is difficult to find martial arts trainers who are skilled in adapting techniques for use by individuals who are totally blind. Second, not all individuals who are blind possess the physical capability of mastering the techniques. Third, training in such self-defense strategies requires a considerable commitment of time for the initial training and subsequent practice to be proficient in the use of the strategies. These same disadvantages apply to any martial art that is specially designed for use by individuals who are blind.The use of pepper spray has unique disadvantages as a self-defense tool for people who are blind because they likely cannot detect where the pepper spray lands after it is discharged. The lack of control over where the spray hits is a strong disadvantage.We do not include the use of the long cane for protection. We realize that the use of the long cane as a weapon may be a seemingly convenient self-defense technique, but this scenario presents numerous hazards and risks. For example, a person who chooses to use their cane to defend themselves can be easily disarmed of the long cane by their attacker and could be left with no mobility tool with which to travel in their environment.We believe that there are other, more effective strategies to consider as primary methods of self-defense against a perpetrator. These methods and tools are outlined in this article. We emphasize that there is no way to guarantee complete safety for anyone using the tools or strategies that are described here. Therefore, we emphasize that the information presented in this article is designed to reduce vulnerability, not to guarantee safety.An additional point to be made here is that the recommendations are designed for use by people who are blind and who are traveling independently in the environment. The recommendations are not designed to protect individuals who are vulnerable to attack by family members or acquaintances of the family. These are dangers that unfortunately exist and require a completely separate discussion, apart from the information presented in this article.To begin, we believe that the most effective and most easily implemented strategy is the use of a trained guide dog. We understand that guide dogs are not trained to be guard dogs. We also understand from personal experience and existing research that individuals who belong to the sighted community view dogs as protective (American Kennel Club, 2021).We realize that this strategy, unlike those that follow, requires a substantial investment of time and effort on the part of the person who is visually impaired to acquire and maintain a guide dog. However, there is no special training required on the part of the guide dog or the person who is visually impaired in terms of the suggested personal safety benefit of guide dogs. It is simply the presence of a guide dog that likely makes a difference in terms of personal safety.Additionally, we present a novel concept that dogs of particular colors or breeds may decrease the likelihood of assault, merely based on the public\\'s perception of the particular dogs\\' aggression. We share this novel concept as a result of the personal experience of one of the authors, who has used three dogs, two of one color and one of another. He has noted that the colors of the dogs\\' coats have made a difference in the perception of the sighted public.In general, the colors of dogs may affect the perception of the aggression of the dogs, regardless of the breed. There is some scientific support for the concept that the color may cause some members of the public to view the dog as more or less dangerous. In a 2018 study conducted by Stanley Coren on behalf of the American Kennel Club, people rated photographs of Labrador Retrievers that differed only in color. The result showed that dogs with darker coats were perceived as more aggressive (Coren, 2018).Breed may also have an impact on the perception of a dog as a protector. A German shepherd, for example, is often seen as the most protective breed.(American Kennel Club, 2021). German Shepherds are often bred to be working dogs by the military and law enforcement, which are two highly protective career paths. Therefore, the general public may regard German Shepherd guide dogs as more protective of their owners.Based on these factors, individuals who are blind and who desire to travel using a guide dog may want to consider the breed and color of the dog. We make these suggestions as a novel concept for those who may be considering a guide dog for the first time. We also recognize that guide dog schools may not adhere to this novel suggestion about the consideration of guide dog color and/or breed in terms of protection from physical harm by strangers.The following recommendations are based on four requirements for inclusion. First, the tool must be accessible to people who are visually impaired to be recommended for use. Second, the tool must be inexpensive to be recommended for use. Third, the tool must be easily implemented without extensive training to be recommended for use. Last, the tool, of course, must be considered to be effective in reducing the individual\\'s vulnerability to sexual assault to be recommended for use. We have compiled a list of recommendations and tools that may be used to reduce the vulnerability of people who are blind to physical and sexual assault. Table summarizes the tools that are discussed in detail in the paragraphs that follow (Table).The Sting Ring is a small device that is carried in the palm of the hand. The user positions it so that a finger protrudes through the ring and the base of the device is held in the palm of the hand. The device has an on/off switch that can easily be manipulated by the thumb. The ring portion of the device produces an electrical charge. a bright light, and a loud sound.It is a \"taser-like\" device that, when triggered, emits a strong electrical charge while making a loud sound that results from the discharge of electricity. It is designed to be pressed against a portion of the body of an attacker while the palm of the hand is squeezed. That action causes the device to emit an electrical charge while producing a loud sound. The electrical charge produces a strong contraction of the muscles of the body in the location where the device is in contact. It is recommended that the electrical charge be induced for no longer than five seconds. The resulting contractions of the muscle as well as the pain are designed to cause an attacker to relent.The device has a recharging plug that can be inserted into a wall socket to renew the electrical charge of the device\\'s battery. The reader should be aware that \"taser-like\" devices, such as the Sting Ring, require the owner to hold a Firearms Owner Identification permit (FOID card) in some states. We believe that this small, relatively inexpensive device can be used with great effectiveness by a person who is blind. Sight is not required for its use. One need only be in physical contact with the recipient of the painful electrical charge. A person who is blind and who is being attacked will undoubtedly be in physical contact with their attacker, making the use of the device easily manageable. A second advantage of the Sting Ring is that it cannot easily be taken from the user because it is held in the palm of the hand with a finger protruding through the ring portion. A third advantage is that it cannot be easily used against the defender. If the person using this device for self-defense does not put pressure on it by squeezing the palm, it will not \"fire off\". A fourth advantage of the device is that the sound that it makes is alarming. We believe that merely pointing it at a potential attacker and causing it to fire off without actually touching the attacker would do much to discourage a perpetrator.The sound that the device makes and the spewing of the light of the electric charge may, in our estimation, discourage some people with visual impairments from using it. That same illusion of deadliness that discourages some people from using it may also have the same effect on potential attackers.The Sting Ring is found on the Home Security Superstore for the price of $18.95. The website where the Sting Ring can be found for purchase is available at https://www.thehomesecuritysuperstore.com/products/streetwise-sting-ring-knuckle-stun-gun-black-18m.For additional information about the Sting Ring, the reader is encouraged to view a YouTube video review of this device, located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmBB8tb8fqU. This particular video review describes the device in detail and includes a demonstration of the device being used to transmit its high voltage surge into the air, away from any person. It is a short video, 2 minutes and 25 seconds in length, that can answer many questions that readers may have about this device. Figures 1, 2, and 3 each show a picture of the Streetwise Sting Ring.The Cat Ear Spike Ring consists of a metal ring with two sharp spikes protruding from it. The ring can be worn on any of the fingers with the spikes pointing outward.There are several advantages of the Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring. It is inexpensive, does not require any kind of setup or charging, and is easy to conceal. This device is usable with and without vision. To our knowledge, its use is not forbidden by any legislation. It would be difficult for the attacker to take the ring away from the user or to use it against the person being attacked. The use of this device may be more acceptable by some people when compared with the previously mentioned Sting Ring. We note that there are also other similar defense rings available, such as the Defender Ring and other models. We have presented the Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring in particular because of its design elements of having two distinct, large spikes and a smooth side of the ring. This smooth side of the ring is distinct and has no spikes or tactile marks of any kind to allow the person wearing the ring to have the ring securely and properly worn when feeling the ring by touch.The use of the ring is obvious. Should a person be physically attacked, they would likely be in physical contact with the attacker. In that position, the person being attacked could administer a blow to any portion of the attacker\\'s body, hurting or puncturing the attacker\\'s skin with the sharp portion of the ring.There are certain disadvantages in the use of the Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring. The person defending themselves using this device must strike uncovered portions of the attacker\\'s body. The sharp portion of the ring may not penetrate thick clothing, especially if the person being attacked does not have considerable strength in their arms as they administer the blow or blows. The recommended approach is to strike the attacker\\'s face, but the person being attacked, not possessing sight, may have difficulty reaching the face of the attacker. Also, it might be the case that the attacker\\'s face is not readily accessible to the person being attacked.The Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring is found on various sites for various prices, ranging in cost from approximately $5 to approximately $20. A Google search using the terms \"Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring\" results in several sources from which this self-defense tool can be purchased. Figures 4 and 5 each show a picture of the Cat Ear Spike Defense Ring.There are numerous personal keychain alarms that can be purchased. Generally, these are inexpensive. Additionally, personal keychain alarms are easily carried and concealed, and they are usable with and without vision. There are no complex actions that must be taken to operate them; thus, the use of personal keychain alarms is easily learned without any required setup. Another advantage is that personal keychain alarms cannot be used against the person being attacked. The major disadvantage is that the alarm may be ignored by others, given the prevalence of car alarms, which are frequently heard in some environments.Personal keychain alarms are available on Amazon, ranging in price from $15 to $30 for a six-pack of multiple keychain alarms. Figures 6, 7, and 8 show pictures of an assortment of personal keychain alarms.The Care Go Personal Alarm is in the shape of a small cylinder, approximately three inches in length and approximately the diameter of a dime. The top third of the device is a triggering mechanism that the user can rotate and pull to engage the alarm. At the top of the device, a small connection allows it to be attached to a keychain. That portion of the device can be removed to gain access to the charging port. The device is linked to the Care Go App, which the owner of the device and their contacts of choice must download. The owner is required to pair the device with the Care Go App that is present on their phone. The instructions for this procedure are automatically started when the owner opens the app for the first time. The owner should ask friends or family members to download the Care Go App and designate themselves as \"protectors\". The device provides precise location details, and, using the app, the protectors can see the location of the device at all times. The device works in two ways. If the owner is moving through an environment and feels unsafe, they can twist the device to initiate the \"follow me\" mode. This action automatically sends a signal to the protectors\\' devices. As soon as the protectors touch the notifications on their phones and open the Care Go App, they can see the location of the phone owner. From the app, the protectors are able to determine the location of the owner. The individual being contacted can call the owner via the app. The protector can also track the movement of the owner via the app. In this way, the protectors are aware that their loved one feels unsafe and can reach out to them and/or easily observe their route.If the person who is blind feels they are in immediate danger, they can send an SOS signal to their contacts. This can be done by triggering the device by pulling the top, causing it to snap. The protectors\\' phones emit a loud sound that directs their immediate attention to the situation. The protectors can open the app, which will provide them with the location of the person. The protectors can call the owner if needed. If the owner twists the triggering mechanism and snaps it back down, then the \"follow me\" and SOS signals are cancelled. The protectors can still continue to view the owner\\'s location and check on them if they wish.The device has several advantages. It is small and easy to carry. This device and the Care Go App are accessible to people with visual impairments. The device has both a \"follow me\" and an SOS feature. Thus, protectors can discriminate between the person feeling unsafe or being in immediate danger and can take the appropriate action. According to the owner\\'s manual, the device needs to be charged only once a year. Perhaps the major advantage is that it is easier to manipulate than dialing a phone during an emergency because it requires only one small movement of the fingers to activate.The Care Go Personal Alarm is found on Amazon for approximately $45. Figure 9 is a picture of the Care Go Personal Alarm side by side a screen shot of a smart phone with the SOS Mode of the Care Go Alarm engaged.An SOS function can be found on many different types of smartphones. Thus, one major advantage is that there is no additional cost to invoke this on a smartphone that someone already owns. The SOS capability on iPhones and Android devices is accessible to people with visual impairments.This feature on iPhones enables one to immediately call emergency services after quickly clicking the power button (also known as the Sleep/Wake button) five times in a sequence. After pressing the power button five times quickly, an emergency SOS \"slider\" appears, enabling one to cancel the SOS alert signal by tapping the phone. If the alarm is not canceled, the phone is linked to a 911 operator. If the individual is unable to speak and has their medical ID imbedded in their phone, their ID card will be shared with local emergency services personnel. Once the call with emergency services personnel is concluded, the iPhone sends the emergency contacts a text message with the person\\'s current location. If the phone\\'s location identification capability is off, the phone will temporarily turn it on. When the person\\'s location changes, the person\\'s contacts will receive an update, and the contacts will receive a notification about 10 minutes later. Android phones have an SOS emergency feature that is set up in a similar manner and works in the same way. Clients and students who are visually impaired may require assistance in setting up their emergency contacts.There are several advantages of the SOS feature on smartphones. As mentioned, the feature is built into a smartphone. Generally, people nearly always have their phones in their possession, especially when traveling independently. Also, the feature is easy to set up for those who are familiar with the smartphone interface.A disadvantage of smartphone SOS functionality is that rapidly pressing the button several times in a row may be difficult to accomplish during an attack. Figure 10 shows screen shots of the iPhone SOS function and Figure 11 shows screen shots of the Android SOS function.Finally, we recommend that people who are visually impaired should be instructed on the use of their bodies to attempt to defend themselves. As stated earlier, we do not recommend training in any type of martial art, given the reasons previously stated. However, we do recommend that an individual who is being attacked should take actions that may stop the attacker. These involve maneuvers such as screaming and wildly thrashing about. An individual who is attacked can scratch, bite, kick, pinch, spit, pull hair, and perform any other action they can devise. A person who is being attacked can go limp and suddenly follow this by flailing wildly, twisting, jumping, and then going limp again and repeating the actions over and over.As explained by Bozeman (2004) \"the body can serve as a weapon for striking the attacker with the hands, fists, knees, feet, elbows, fingers, and head; biting; pinching; and/or yelling to attract attention\" (p. 436). An additional suggestion to attract attention when yelling is to yell \"fire\" instead of \"help\" because \"fire\" may trigger a quicker reaction from others who may hear the shouts.These maneuvers and techniques can be practiced by people who are visually impaired. It is important that the person who is visually impaired understands why they should appear to be in this crazed state when being attacked. The more difficult the person makes it for the attacker, the more difficult it is for the attacker to carry out any contemptible intentions. Additionally, these actions may draw the attention of others who may be in the area. If others are not in the area, these actions may cause the attacker to relent because of the possibility that others, unseen by the attacker, may view the actions that the attacker is attempting to carry out. If this approach is taken, we recommend that individuals who are blind be given the opportunity to practice these behaviors in a safe environment.There are many books on the topics of personal safety and empowerment that are readily accessible to people with visual impairments. While some of the books indicate by the title of the work that the content is written for women, the reality is that the safety tips apply to all humans, especially those who may be the most vulnerable, regardless of gender or gender identity status. Several examples of books that focus on physical safety and empowerment and are available on Bookshare and/or Audible include:Additionally, there are many self-help books that were written to aid in the recovery of rape and assault survivors. Many of these books are available on Bookshare and/or Audible and, therefore, are readily accessible to people with visual impairments. Examples of these books include the following:Physical and sexual assault among people who are visually impaired is a long-standing problem that has been documented in the literature for more than half a century. The purpose of this manuscript is to share meaningful methods and accessible tools that may be used to decrease vulnerability to physical and sexual assault for people with visual impairments.In conclusion, we do not want the reader to overestimate the effectiveness of the tools or actions presented in this manuscript. The use of a self-defense device will not guarantee that a person who is blind and traveling alone is invulnerable to assault. No strategy can guarantee total safety in today\\'s unfortunate environment. However, these tools and strategies are recommended to further empower people who are visually impaired throughout their lives.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"The reproducibility of scientific articles is central to the advancement of science. Despite this importance, evaluating reproducibility remains challenging due to the scarcity of ground truth data. Predictive models can address this limitation by streamlining the tedious evaluation process. Typically, a paper's reproducibility is inferred based on the availability of artifacts such as code, data, or supplemental information, often without extensive empirical investigation. To address these issues, we utilized artifacts of papers as fundamental units to develop a novel, dual-spectrum framework that focuses on author-centric and external-agent perspectives. We used the author-centric spectrum, followed by the external-agent spectrum, to guide a structured, model-based approach to quantify and assess reproducibility. We explored the interdependencies between different factors influencing reproducibility and found that linguistic features such as readability and lexical diversity are strongly correlated with papers achieving the highest statuses on both spectrums. Our work provides a model-driven pathway for evaluating the reproducibility of scientific research. The code, methods, and artifacts for our study are publicly available at: https://github.com/reproducibilityproject/NLRR/\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Purpose This paper proposes a novel conceptual framework to guide future research in service technology with a focus on sustainability. Drawing on Eastern philosophical perspectives, this framework advocates for integrating the human-nature oneness concept into service technology design. Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews existing literature on service technology and sustainability, highlighting gaps in addressing the environmental impacts of emerging technologies. Established on the systematic literature review, this conceptual paper introduces a holistic framework informed by Eastern philosophies of Daoism, Buddhism, and Ubuntu, advocating for an integrated approach to perceiving humans and nature as interconnected. Findings The proposed framework challenges the current human-centric perspective in service technology research, which often prioritizes economic and social sustainability over environmental considerations. By adopting a holistic view, the framework suggests that true sustainability can only be achieved by simultaneously fostering human and environmental prosperity. Practical implications The framework provides theoretical and practical guidance on aligning service technology development with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The current research advocates for a shift towards designing service technologies that not only enhance service efficiency and economic performance but also mitigate negative environmental impacts. Originality/value This paper introduces a radical shift in thinking about sustainability in service technology by integrating Eastern philosophical principles. It offers a new lens for addressing global sustainability challenges and contributing to the growing body of research on sustainable service ecosystems.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['A growing body of research and scholarship suggests that international students, particularly those with Black African or Asian backgrounds, experience race and identity on U.S. college campuses in complex and sometimes unexpected ways. They are, like many college students, for the first time exploring their own identity while trying to navigate their way through U.S.-based racial stereotypes placed on them by others, for which they have little historical context. At the same time, many campus communities do not provide the space for students to make sense of these intersectional identities. Assuming a monolithic experience among all international students (even for those from the same region or country) makes it even more difficult for them to navigate their experiences.',\n",
       "   'Preparing student affairs and international education professionals to support international students may seem daunting considering the cultural diversity of the international student population in the United States. However, one does not necessarily need to be an expert on international students to support them, nor do they need to have had extensive intercultural experiences to appear competent when working with students from various cultural backgrounds. Cultural humility, the process of understanding others by first critically examining our own beliefs and identities, is core to the student affairs ethos. This chapter posits that training staff to approach situations through a lens of cultural humility can be an effective way to prepare student affairs and international education professionals for working with international students.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract: The field of student affairs has seen an exodus of staff members over the past few years. Employee attrition, however, is not a new problem in student affairs. This grounded theory study aimed to understand why student affairs professionals leave the field. Based on interviews with student affairs professionals who left the field between March 2020 and March 2022, we developed a departure model that describes participants' experiences from their interest in and socialization into the field to their departure. Our model highlights how the conflicts between personal life, values, and approach to work and institutional policies, practices, and leadership rooted in white supremacy decreased participants' commitment to staying in the field over time. While our model focuses on departure, it also points to opportunities for disrupting current practices and transforming the working conditions in the field to attract and retain a diverse staff of student affairs professionals. In sharing implications, we take a both/and approach, highlighting how we can disrupt white supremacy culture and decolonize higher education and how we can foster student affairs professionals' ability to navigate the current cultural norms and environments.\",\n",

       "   'Promoting staff well-being has been a challenge for many residence life departments long before the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in the mental well-being of the general population as well as in residence life staff. The stressful work environment and demanding work hours in residence life have been linked to burnout and intentions to leave the field. This qualitative study explored the experiences of residence life staff during the pandemic, which, with its heightened stressors, provided a rich backdrop for studying ways to improve praxis in residence life by reducing stress and work demands and improving staff well-being. Based on interviews with 17 residence life staff, we found that the pandemic exacerbated challenges related to transparent communication and decision-making and affected professionals’ ability to balance work and personal life, challenges that had existed in departments prior to the pandemic. Participants responded to these challenges by prioritizing their well-being, re-evaluating their careers, and leveraging technology to improve residence life praxis. We discuss implications for altering practice after the pandemic to increase staff well-being by facilitating start-stop-continue activities to address issues with workload and connecting staff to mental health services.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['ABSTRACT Most economic models of the illegal drugs market focus on demand‐side behavior. However, in imperfectly competitive markets such as the illegal drugs market, it is the seller who determines price. Moreover, even models that focus on supply‐side behavior often ignore key factors such as risk. This paper develops an expected utility model of a risk‐averse seller. We find that under risk aversion, increasing punishment costs (i.e., severity) is more effective than increased enforcement (i.e., certainty) and demand reduction is more effective than interdiction. If risk neutrality is assumed, increases in severity and certainty have the same deterrent effect. Under risk neutrality, the deterrent effect of demand reduction policies dominates all other interdiction policies. These results lend theoretical reinforcement to the growing policy bias in favor of demand‐side intervention.'],\n",

Implementing an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, 26 ELs completed five funds-of-knowledge-featured narrative writing essays in ten weeks operating under a switching replications quasi-experimental design. When controlling for the five writing topics, the results from mixed-effects multilevel modeling analysis revealed statistically significant and positive effects of the MBWT on the development of the ELs’ writing skills. The results also showed that the effect of the MBWT on writing performance was stronger for male students than for females. Findings of a follow-up qualitative research phase indicated that ELs had positive perceptions toward the adoption of the MBWT. Potential factors that influenced the integrated learning and gender effects were explored as well. This study is significant for engaging teachers in exploring the potential of designing and implementing inclusive mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) for diverse ethnic-minority student populations.',\n",
       "   \"Introduction Many physician assistant/associate (PA) programs lack point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) education in the PA curricula and a standardized approach to ultrasound training. The four-component instructional design (4C/ID) model merges 4 concepts for developing effective instructional design content for complex content delivery, such as ultrasound. This research study created an interactive, 2-part ultrasound curriculum with an instructional designer for PA students using the 4C/ID model. Methods Two interactive ultrasound curriculum models were created from the 4C/ID model using a knowledge-based precurriculum quiz, learning tasks with online modules and recordings, part-task practice with ultrasound experts, skills checkoffs, and a postcurriculum quiz including questions on students' perspectives of ultrasound. Two-tailed paired t -test analysis assessed the effectiveness of training. Results Evaluation of prelearning and postlearning quizzes demonstrated multiple statistically significant assessments supporting the use of instructional design technology for a PA program's ultrasound curriculum. Discussion This small study demonstrated that the 4C/ID model may be beneficial for PA POCUS training. The 2-part interactive curriculum improved PA student competency of ultrasound principles and applications and increased confidence for future clinical use of ultrasound.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract This paper describes the experience with the calibration, reconstruction and evaluation of the timing capabilities of the CMS HGCAL prototype in the beam tests in 2018. The calibration procedure includes multiple steps and corrections ranging from tens of nanoseconds to a few hundred picoseconds. The timing performance is studied using signals from positron beam particles with energies between 20 GeV and 300 GeV. The performance is studied as a function of particle energy against an external timing reference as well as standalone by comparing the two different halves of the prototype. The timing resolution is found to be 60 ps for single-channel measurements and better than 20 ps for full showers at the highest energies, setting excellent perspectives for the HGCAL calorimeter performance at the HL-LHC.',\n",
       "   'A neural network for software compensation was developed for the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL). The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   \"Abstract A novel method to reconstruct the energy of hadronic showers in the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) is presented. The HGCAL is a sampling calorimeter with very fine transverse and longitudinal granularity. The active media are silicon sensors and scintillator tiles readout by SiPMs and the absorbers are a combination of lead and Cu/CuW in the electromagnetic section, and steel in the hadronic section. The shower reconstruction method is based on graph neural networks and it makes use of a dynamic reduction network architecture. It is shown that the algorithm is able to capture and mitigate the main effects that normally hinder the reconstruction of hadronic showers using classical reconstruction methods, by compensating for fluctuations in the multiplicity, energy, and spatial distributions of the shower's constituents. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using test beam data collected in 2018 prototype of the CMS HGCAL accompanied by a section of the CALICE AHCAL prototype. The capability of the method to mitigate the impact of energy leakage from the calorimeter is also demonstrated.\",\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

The 2020 ESPP Report emphasized the need for Advanced Accelerator R\\\\&D, and the 2023 P5 Report calls for the ``delivery of an end-to-end design concept, including cost scales, with self-consistent parameters throughout.\" This Design Study leverages recent experimental and theoretical progress resulting from a global R\\\\&D program in order to deliver a unified, 10 TeV Wakefield Collider concept. Wakefield Accelerators provide ultra-high accelerating gradients which enables an upgrade path that will extend the reach of Linear Colliders beyond the electroweak scale. Here, we describe the organization of the Design Study including timeline and deliverables, and we detail the requirements and challenges on the path to a 10 TeV Wakefield Collider.',\n",
       "   'Nitrogen-incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond [(N)UNCD] pyramid tip cathode has been considered as a next-generation high peak current electron source for dielectric laser accelerators as well as other high peak current particle accelerator applications. In this work, we study non-linear photoemission from an (N)UNCD pyramid tip cathode using an ultrafast laser with the pulse length of 150 fs with the central wavelength of 800 nm in the peak intensity range of 109–1010W/cm2. We demonstrated that as the incident laser intensity increases, the current emitted from the nano-tip first increases as a power function with an exponent of about 5 and then starts to roll over to an exponent of 3. This roll over is attributed to the Coulomb interaction between electrons emitted from the tip also known as the space charge. We also measured the photoemission electron energy spectra that show electrons with energies as high as ∼10 eV. Based on the shape of the electron energy spectra, we conclude that the high-energy electrons are thermally emitted electrons due to ultrafast laser heating at the tip of the (N)UNCD pyramid tip cathode.',\n",

Based on the analysis, we propose a theoretical model of “(un)victimization” that integrates two inequality frames – misogynoir and legal cynicism – applied to sexual assault. Specifically, this model explains the experiences of Black women survivors of sexual violence who simultaneously experience sexual victimization, are denied legitimate victim status, and have reason to distrust legal forms of justice. We theorize the process of (un)victimization enables future sexual assault of Black women.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant weaknesses in the healthcare information system. The overwhelming volume of misinformation on social media and other socioeconomic factors created extraordinary challenges to motivate people to take proper precautions and get vaccinated. In this context, our work explored a novel direction by analyzing an extensive dataset collected over two years, identifying the topics de/motivating the public about COVID-19 vaccination. We analyzed these topics based on time, geographic location, and political orientation. We noticed that while the motivating topics remain the same over time and geographic location, the demotivating topics rapidly. We also identified that intrinsic motivation, rather than external mandate, is more advantageous to inspire the public. This study addresses scientific communication and public motivation in social media. It can help public health officials, policymakers, and social media platforms develop more effective messaging strategies to cut through the noise of misinformation and educate the public about scientific findings.',\n",
       "   'In this study, a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) approach is proposed for Relative Humidity (RH) prediction with a combination of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to improve the prediction accuracy over the traditional prediction technique using a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm called Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main objective of proposing this hybrid technique is to deal with the extremely nonlinear and noisy humidity pattern in Khulna, Bangladesh, which is experiencing rapid urbanization and environmental change. To develop the model, data on temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), and the data was divided into three phases: 70 % of the historical dataset as training data for the model, 15 % of the data set as the validation phase, and the remaining 15 % of the data set as the test phase of the model. Employing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, the SVM model determines its best hypermeters within this research. In the present research, performance analysis is carried out utilizing the Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Results show that the increase in R2 values resulting from the EMD-based approach is significant: 21.05 % in H1(Traditional model), 19.48 % in H2 (Traditional model), 76.92 % in H3 (Traditional model), 55.93 % in H4 (Traditional model), and 64.29 % in H5 (Traditional model) and H6 (Traditional model). The analytical results show that the proposed EMD-based technique efficiently filters and processes noisy, highly nonlinear humidity data during prediction in the Khulna region. It is recommended that this technique could be applied to other geological areas.',\n",

       "   'Purpose With the remarkable capability to reach the public instantly, social media has become integral in sharing scholarly articles to measure public response. Since spamming by bots on social media can steer the conversation and present a false public interest in given research, affecting policies impacting the public’s lives in the real world, this topic warrants critical study and attention. Design/methodology/approach We used the Altmetric dataset in combination with data collected through the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) and the Botometer API. We combined the data into an extensive dataset with academic articles, several features from the article and a label indicating whether the article had excessive bot activity on Twitter or not. We analyzed the data to see the possibility of bot activity based on different characteristics of the article. We also trained machine-learning models using this dataset to identify possible bot activity in any given article. Findings Our machine-learning models were capable of identifying possible bot activity in any academic article with an accuracy of 0.70. We also found that articles related to “Health and Human Science” are more prone to bot activity compared to other research areas. Without arguing the maliciousness of the bot activity, our work presents a tool to identify the presence of bot activity in the dissemination of an academic article and creates a baseline for future research in this direction. Research limitations/implications We considered the features available from the Altmetric dataset. It can be exciting research to extract additional features about the authors of the article, the location of the publication, international collaboration and other demographic features of the authors to see the relation of these features with bot activity. Practical implications Since public interest in scientific findings can shape the decisions of policymakers, it is essential to identify the possibility of bot activity in the dissemination of any given scholarly article. Without arguing whether the social bots are good or bad and without arguing about the validity of a scholarly article, our work proposes a tool to interpret the public interest in an article by identifying the possibility of bot activity toward an article. This work publishes the models and data generated through the study and provides a benchmark and guideline for future works in this direction. Originality/value While the majority of the existing research focuses on identifying and preventing bot activity on social media, our work is novel in predicting the possibility of bot activity in the dissemination of an academic article using Altmetric metadata for the article. Little work has been performed in this specific area, and the models developed from our research give policymakers and the public a tool to interpret and understand the public interest in a scientific publication with appropriate caution.',\n",
       "   'Noise pollution is mostly a man made phenomenon, which induces health problems when exposed to it for long term. The purpose of this engineering study is to analyse and assess the noise level of some selected suburban areas of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. The research recognizes common sources of noise pollution, including transportation, industrial and household activities, outdoor recreation and some natural events, all of which can have detrimental effects on human health, including hearing loss, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular diseases and cognitive impairments. The research highlights substantial noise level fluctuations in various suburbs, notably in Rockdale, Kogarah, Sydenham, and Tempe, where afternoon noise surpasses the 80 dB EPA threshold in specific instances, linked to heightened vehicular traffic and human activity during school and work hours. Conversely, Hurstville suburb exhibits distinct morning noise peaks close to the EPA threshold, emphasizing the localised nature of noise pollution and the impact of specific temporal and spatial factors, while Wolli Creek maintains an average noise level close to the threshold at 76.13 dB.'],\n",

       "   'Abstract Increasingly democracy is becoming digitalized through the use of information technologies in the conduct of elections and political campaigns. At the same time, politics is becoming more contentious, and even subversive, as democracy fuses with divisive social issues and identity politics. This article examines the issue of subversive politics in a variety of democracy settings. As the authors show, subversive politics is an issue that is affecting emerging and established democracies. Yet, the effect can be more severe in the former as democratic institutions are still developing. Notably, Muslim-majority countries face major challenges in making democracy work due to subversive politics and the political and ideological conflicts between different Muslim groups. As such, the article niches on the intersection of (digitalized) electoral democracy with subversive politics with a special focus on Indonesia as a Muslim-majority democracy. The authors argue that Indonesia stands as an in-between case in the continuum of subversive politics. They show this by explaining how democracy failed in some Muslim countries, became threatened in consolidated democracies, and survives in Indonesia. The combination of institutional quality and relative independence of religious organizations in politics has been crucial for the way Indonesia deals with subversive politics.'],\n",

This chapter surveys and reassesses diverse scholarly approaches to Sidney’s political career in relation to the question of political theory implicit within his Arcadia. On Sidney’s political activity, dominant biographical premises of the late twentieth century need to be reconciled more precisely with documentary evidence of royal favour and with current historiography regarding the foreign policy of Elizabeth I and her inner regime. On political theory, the hermeneutic terms of a long-standing debate should be adjusted regarding law and religion, so as to identify more precisely intellectual convergence and divergence between specific sixteenth-century theories associated and dissociated with Sidney’s thought in modern scholarship. Here new analysis of the Arcadia’s texts focuses on their nuanced representations of sovereignty and rebellion, whereby Sidney’s fiction conveys a political perspective that extends the Lutheran legacy of Philip Melanchthon while both qualifying and complementing it with a legal particularism reminiscent of Jean Bodin’s political thought.',\n",
       "   'Abstract This chapter reassesses critical interpretations of two royal entertainments involving Philip Sidney: a privately performed rustic comedy which he authored, The Lady of May, performed at his uncle Robert Dudley’s estate in Wanstead, Essex, in 1578; and an internationally public chivalric pageant in which he participated, The Four Foster Children of Desire, or Fortress of Perfect Beauty, performed at court in 1581. Both events featured Queen Elizabeth I directly in their dramatic action. This comparison of artistic designs and reconsideration of underlying motives emphasises that the theatrical deference both works show to the queen’s decision-making dramatised and affirmed her royal prerogative in matters of foreign policy.'],\n",

The avian vampire fly (Philornis downsi), introduced to the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador, has emerged as a major threat to the endemic avifauna, parasitizing multiple species of Darwin's finches and other passerines. Yet, the genetic mechanisms of its invasion remain unclear. In this study, we conducted the first whole-genome sequencing analysis of P. downsi populations from the Galápagos Islands and their native range in mainland Ecuador. Our results reveal genomic signatures of a founder effect, with reduced genetic diversity in the Galápagos populations, indicative of a recent population bottleneck. We found a lack of significant genetic differentiation and evidence of ongoing gene flow among island populations. Despite low genetic diversity in island populations, we identified adaptive genetic changes, including regions possibly under positive selection near genes related to neural signaling, muscle development, and metabolic processes, which may have contributed to the fly's invasion success. Additionally, we uncovered genetic changes associated with precipitation-related climate adaptation, highlighting the possible role of environmental factors in shaping genetic variation in P. downsi. Our findings provide crucial insights into the invasion dynamics of P. downsi in Galápagos, emphasizing the importance of genomic research in informing conservation strategies. The identification of key adaptive genomic loci and potential environmental drivers of genetic change will aid in the development of targeted management practices to mitigate the impact of this invasive species on the unique biodiversity of the Galápagos Islands.\",\n",

This study examines the influence of urbanization on the detrimental effect of invasive avian vampire flies (Philornis downsi) on endemic Darwin's finches in the Galápagos Islands. We experimentally manipulated nest fly abundance in urban and non-urban locations and then characterized nestling health, fledging success, diet, and gene expression patterns related to host defense. Fledging success of non-parasitized nestlings from urban (79%) and non-urban (75%) nests did not differ significantly. However, parasitized, non-urban nestlings lost more blood, and fewer nestlings survived (8%) compared to urban nestlings (50%). Stable isotopic values (δ\",\n",

However, there are likely more employees with disabilities than those who disclose at work. We tested whether altering the response option language on a disclosure form would increase disability disclosures, and whether increases differed by disability type and visibility. Employed adults were asked to identify as having a “disability,” “qualifying impairment,” “qualifying condition,” or “qualifying disability.” Results showed more disclosures when reporting a “qualifying condition” compared to a “disability,” especially among employees with a psychological or invisible disability. The manipulation of a single term on the disclosure form can increase reporting of disabilities, providing an evidence-based step to support inclusive organizational practices.'],\n",

       "   'Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show how the impact of White Supremacy and Christian hegemony on the educational system. By highlighting interconnectedness across targeted groups, the authors assert that through coalition building, groups are stronger than they would be working alone. Solidarity gives hope to combating hatred of all kinds. Learning that there is a long history of antisemitism is an important component of fighting bias. With book banning and controversy over teaching critical race theory in schools, it is important that educators reflect on their social justice education. Design/methodology/approach The authors analyze the definitions and enactment of multicultural, culturally responsive and anti-bias education as well as critical theory. They then investigate how antisemitism is of concern to all identities targeted by White Supremacy and Christian Nationalism (LGBTQIA+, minoritized races, non-Christians, etc.) and the importance of education in fighting hate and influencing policy and practice. Findings Although 2 % of the US population identifies as Jewish, 11% of incidents educators reported were classified as antisemitic. Education is the key to fighting antisemitism and Holocaust denial (Greene et al. , 2021; Stanton and Marcus, 2019). The authors make recommendations for addressing antisemitism, including addressing antisemitic incidents, the importance of Holocaust studies, the need for religious literacy, fighting the banning of books and narrowing the school curriculum. The authors ended by reinforcing the need for Jewish people to be included in multicultural, culturally responsive, anti-bias education and the need for “Heb-crit” as a sub-study of critical race theory. Social implications Anti-bias education must include antisemitism and show how connected hatred is rather than having groups compare their struggles. The authors explained the diversity among Jewish people to highlight the complexity of an identity group that is often inaccurately oversimplified. Originality/value There is a need for scholarship on modern-day antisemitism and internalized antisemitism and reflective narratives as commonly used in Black and Latinx studies (Rubin, 2020). With the rise in Holocaust denial and antisemitic groups (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2024), it is important to advocate and teach about these topics, which are not often discussed in PK-12 or Schools of Education (Muller, 2022).',\n",
       "   \"Acclaimed children's books in the United States (U.S.) may be utilized as resources to instruct global issues. As children’s literature reflects social context and values, acclaimed books may provide curricular materials for those within the U.S. and to international audiences. Stakeholders, including librarians, teachers, national industry experts, and parents, are among those who review and award prizes to children’s literature. This work has resulted in booklists teachers, families, and librarians use to guide their book purchasing and sharing practices. We investigate the histories, composition, and criteria for 22 award and acclaimed U.S. children’s book lists containing 4,244 titles. Fewer than 100 titles appear consistently across multiple stakeholder lists. International audiences will become more aware of the types of U.S. awards for children’s literature that exist and reflect on the award and acclaimed book lists published in their countries and how they might be used by teachers, parents, and other stakeholders.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Research describes pivots as quick and comprehensive change in venture direction triggered by (external) opportunity-based information suggesting a better opportunity. We discovered two distinct pivot types in a qualitative study (Study 1), neither of which fully aligns with prior research. “Opportunity pivots” are triggered by opportunity-based information but are slower and less comprehensive than previously described; “survival pivots” are rapid and comprehensive but triggered by (internal) threat-based information. Lacking theory to explain our discoveries, we tested competing theories in an experimental vignette study involving 1,945 entrepreneurs (Study 2). We find that entrepreneurial learning explains opportunity but not survival pivots, and prospect theory explains survival but not opportunity pivots. The discovery of distinct pivot types provides a foundation for exploring additional pivoting variation; finding support for a different theoretical explanation for each pivot type suggests important limits to core theories used to explain pivoting.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Abstract As photovoltaics (PV) has become an increasingly prominent renewable energy source, utility companies around the world have aggressively been installing PV farms to help meet the growing demand of electricity. Despite the obvious benefit of abundance of energy from the sun, PVs pose some technical challenges when connected to the electric power grid. One issue relates to the unavailability of the sun's energy during nighttime. This causes one critical problem known as the Duck Curve. One method to alleviate this problem is through placements of energy storage. In recent years, many of these two complementary equipment (PV and energy storage) have been installed and operating within electric power grids around the globe. This paper presents a student project to evaluate the performance of a Green Seaport in Indonesia. This is a pilot project where the current electrical system of the seaport will be updated to incorporate both PV and energy storage systems. The project is sponsored by the Ministry of Transportation of Republic of Indonesia and two students are currently participating in the project. The primary goals, tasks, and milestones of the project along with the expected deliverables will be described in this paper. Results from this project and future plans for follow up projects will also be discussed in this paper.\"],\n",

       "   \"ABSTRACT Career resilience is critical to the world's aging workforce, aiding older workers in adapting to the ever‐evolving nature of work. While ageist stereotypes often depict older workers as less resilient when faced with workplace changes, existing research studies offer conflicting evidence on whether older age hinders or improves career resilience. In response to this conflicting evidence, the present study employs multi‐level data from 6772 employees in 28 countries to examine the age‐career resilience relationships and underlying mechanisms, hence advancing our understanding of career resilience across the life course. By integrating macro‐contextual factors such as the unemployment rate and the culture of education with individual‐level mechanisms such as positive career meaning and career optimism, we provide a comprehensive model explaining how career resilience varies across age groups. Grounded in life course theory, our findings resolve prior inconsistencies in resilience research, contribute to bridging the micro‐macro gap in HRM literature, and challenge existing age‐based stereotypes.\",\n",

This Element brings norm-oriented and practice-oriented approaches into conversation to advance a wide-ranging account of change and continuity in global politics. It elaborates four scenarios in which norm and practice interactions produce change and continuity: relative continuity and a tight coupling of practices and norms; change through accidental incompetence; new competencies that create disjunctures; and change through deliberate contestation. It demonstrates the utility of the approach using empirical illustrations from the fields of global health and development The Element also shows the wider applicability of the scenarios for major contemporary debates about change in global governance and security.

       "   'Abstract Communities of practice (CoPs) are important sites of social interaction and are of growing concern in international relations. Much attention has been devoted to examining the existence and effect of these communities, and the kinds of practices and identities they coalesce around. Relatively less attention has been afforded to the relations between a CoP and what lies outside of it. In this article we examine encounters at the boundaries of CoPs. Empirically, we examine the boundaries and interactions of a community of diplomatic practice in the context of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as regional officials engage with extra-regional diplomats and “dialogue partners” operating within and alongside the organization. We find that the “boundary work” of these interactions are important sites of social interaction that constitute communities in important ways and make possible meaningful changes in identity and behavior. More broadly, we show that ASEAN’s unique position as a hub of a multilateral architecture that extends to a wider state membership provides prime terrain to inquire about what happens in liminal spaces of encounter between social agents of varied communities. To advance our claims, we draw on sixty-one semi-structured interviews with regional and extra-regional officials in Jakarta and elsewhere in the region, alongside analysis of public statements from diplomatic practitioners.',\n",
       "   'In this article, we examine the contours of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) response to the latest regional challenge from Myanmar, the 2021 coup. Scholars and practitioners alike often portray ASEAN as a relatively cohesive community of states united in adherence to a long-held and comparatively stable set of norms within the so-called “ASEAN way.” Core among these norms has been domestic non-interference. However, we argue that rather than being determined by a coherent set of agreed norms, ASEAN’s response to this crisis has been shaped by intra-regional contestation and division around how ASEAN ought to enact its particular “way” of regional governance. More narrowly, we show that the ASEAN response has been shaped by contestation over competing normative impulses in the organization—centrality and non-interference—which have developed in increasing tension since the humanitarian disaster after Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and the Rohingya crisis after 2016. We show that in response to these crises, officials from the organization and its member states advanced divergent accounts of what ASEAN ought to do and why, given competing normative commitments to centrality and non-interference. By showing how ASEAN’s response to the 2021 coup is the result of internal contestation within the organization, we support accounts of regional governance in Southeast Asia that stress less the fixity of ASEAN norms than their contestation in practice. To make our argument we analyze more than 250 documents and draw on interviews with regional officials.',\n",

       "   'Abstract Both qualitative and quantitative scholars are increasingly attentive to the importance of reflexivity in research. This chapter highlights the varied ways reflexivity is defined and practiced in political science over three parts. First, it surveys varied understandings of reflexivity from interpretive and positivist corners of the discipline. It highlights conceptions of reflexivity as 1) critical self-reflection on the role and effects of the individual researcher or 2) a broader and critical appraisal of ontological and epistemological suppositions. Second, it argues that engaging reflexivity helps researchers build rapport and working relationships; pursue safe and ethical research; develop fuller accounts of the social world; and facilitate and assess the trustworthiness of research. Third, it surveys scholarship that provides models for reflexivity in interviewing, ethnography, and archival research.'],\n",

A series of tensile tests and multistage microchannel forming tests were conducted on 85 um thick ferritic stainless steel foils, 439L, 444 and Chromeshield® 22, to understand the effect of the forming temperatures, tooling geometry, and processes on their formability. Three microchannel forming processes were conducted, which are 1-Hit (single stage forming), 2-Hit (two-stage forming) with 50% preform, and 2-Hit with 80% preform. FLCos at various microchannel forming conditions were obtained to address the formability of the ferritic stainless steel foils under plane strain conditions. It has been found that the larger the microchannel radius, the better the formability, two-stage forming is superior to single stage process, and a larger draw percentage in preform (stage I) leads to a higher FLCo or better formability. It also has been found from tensile tests that the thermal effect (higher temperature) has a negative impact on the failure strains. Similar phenomenon was also observed through channel forming tests conducted at room temperature, 100°C, and 200°C.',\n",

       "   'The traditional finite element method (FEM) has limitations in accurately modeling crack propagation. Peridynamics, a nonlocal extension of the classical continuum theory, provides an alternative approach to remedy the limitations of the FEM but with a higher computational cost. In this paper, a peridynamic bond-based fatigue damage model is developed and incorporated into a commercial finite-element software (ABAQUS 2017) via user subroutines. Model-predicted results including the crack path spatial position and the damage accumulation rate were validated against empirical data. The predicted crack growth as a function of loading cycle and crack trajectory showed good agreement with the experimental data over 200,000 loading cycles. Therefore, the integration of the peridynamic bond-based fatigue damage model into existing FEM software provides an economical means to simulate complex fracture behaviors, such as crack growth, in a compact tension specimen examined in this paper.'],\n",

       "   'A neural network for software compensation was developed for the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL). The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Introduction: Hemp and other natural fibers are seeing greater use in the industry due to their useful mechanical properties and sustainability. Natural fibers can reinforce or fill polymers to reduce cost and increase biodegradability. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) exhibits exceptional toughness and is capable of being mixed with natural fibers Materials and Methods: In this study, hemp fiber, in powder form, has been blended with UHMWPE powder and processed by compression molding to evaluate mechanical strength properties. The effects of adding low molecular weight polyethylene wax (PE-wax), a property modifier, were also examined. The hemp content of the compositions was 0, 20, 40, 60% w/w, with and without the wax. Results: Consistent with filler behavior, the addition of hemp significantly reduces the ultimate and yield tensile strengths as well as the elongation at break; the effect increases with more hemp. PE-wax improves performance at 40% and 60% w/w hemp, compared to the no wax condition. The presence of hemp increases the elastic modulus for 20% and 40% w/w hemp, and PE-wax improves the elastic modulus at all hemp concentrations. Compressive strength declines as hemp content increases, and the wax raises the performance at all hemp levels, nearly doubling the 20% w/w hemp strength. Shore type D hardness values steadily decline with hemp content, with a 60% loss in hardness, from the pure UHMWPE baseline to the 60% w/w hemp sample. Conclusion: The simplified process outlined in this study produced materials that are fit for use in engineered applications. The process was also much simpler than traditional hand lay-up techniques, making it attractive for use in industrial applications.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['This study assesses the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and stress, as related to healthy lifestyle behaviors among healthcare professionals (HCPs), including medical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, laboratory scientists, and radiologists, in medically underserved regions (MURs). Using a cross-sectional study design, an online survey was administered to HCPs in MURs of West Central Illinois. A total of 316 HCPs completed the survey. The study population was predominantly White, female, and aged 55 or older. The findings of this research imply that HCPs in medically underserved regions (MURs) with high cholesterol generally do not engage in physical activity. The study showed a correlation between HCP age, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol, implying that as HCPs age like every other individual, the likelihood of developing these conditions increases. This study emphasizes the role of time constraints and a lack of motivation in limiting HCPs’ participation in physical activity in rural areas. Additionally, the study suggests that inadequate access to nutritious food and exercise facilities in rural regions contributes to lower rates of healthy eating and physical activity. Findings demonstrate how essential it is for healthcare professionals to remain vigilant about cardiovascular disease risk factors.'],\n",

       "   'Brushite cements (BrCs) are calcium phosphate-based materials that are being widely used in hard tissue engineering applications due to their osteoconductivity, injectability, and bioresorbability. Therefore, the goal was to evaluate the effects of Mg concentration on the phase composition, setting time, and strength of BrC. Mg, which plays a vital role in bodily functions and bone health, was added to BrC at concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, and 2.50 wt.%. The results showed that Mg stabilizes the TCP structure and increases the TCP content in final BrC. The initial and final setting times of BrCs increase with higher concentrations of Mg. Although 0.25 wt.% Mg did not change the setting of BrCs significantly, a higher concentration of 1.00 wt.% increased the initial setting time from 4.87 ± 0.38 min to 15.14 ± 0.88 min. Cements with Mg concentrations of 1.5 wt.% and above did not set after 4 h. Mg addition up to 0.5 wt.% did not change the compressive strength; however, higher concentrations decreased it significantly and 2.5 Mg-BrC had the lowest strength of 0.45 ± 0.09 MPs. Together, our results show that Mg can be added up to 1.00 wt.% without any adverse effect on the physical and mechanical properties of BrC.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Titanium (Ti) and Ti alloys are of great interest in bone and dental tissue engineering applications due to their biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and close mechanical properties to natural bone. However, the formation of fibrous tissue prevents osteointegration and results in implant loosening. Thus, physical and chemical methods are used to improve the surface properties of Ti. This study aimed to understand the role of alkali treatment conditions, including alkali medium concentration, temperature, rotation speed, and post-heat treatment. Our results showed that alkali treatment using 5 and 10 molar sodium hydroxide solution allows the formation of web-like microstructure. However, a higher concentration of 15 molar resulted in cracks along the surface. Interaction between the human fetal osteoblast cells (hfOBs) and Ti samples showed that heat treatment is necessary for increased cellular proliferation, which was not significantly different at later time points compared to the polished Ti. Alkali heat treatment did not induce inflammatory reactions at later time points. It showed an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor, osteoprotegerin/nuclear factor kappa-В ligand ratio, and osteocalcin expression, which is evidence for accelerated osteoblast cell maturation and bone remodeling in surface-modified samples. Together, these data show that alkali treatment using 5 or 10 molar of NaOH followed by heat treatment may have therapeutic effect and assist with bone tissue integration with Ti implant.'],\n",

In an imperfect world of rampant inflation, creeping authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and financial exclusion, bitcoin empowers individuals to elude the expanding reach and tightening grip of institutions both public and private. So although bitcoin is money, it isn't just money. Bitcoin is resistance money. Resistance Money: A Philosophical Case for Bitcoin begins by explaining why bitcoin was invented, how it works, and where it fits among other kinds of money. The authors then offer a framework for evaluating bitcoin from a global perspective and use it to examine bitcoin's monetary policy, censorship-resistance, privacy, inclusion, and energy use. The book develops a comprehensive and measured case that bitcoin is a net benefit to the world, despite its imperfections. Resistance Money is intended for all, from the clueless to the specialist, from the proponent to the die-hard skeptic, and everyone in between. Key Features: Provides a philosophical approach that makes use of multiple disciplines in its analysis Offers a clearly written, measured academic treatment of bitcoin, comprehensive in scope and free of ideological baggage Includes information on the financial, social, and environmental costs of bitcoin, how these costs are sometimes exaggerated, and how they might be mitigated Addresses the strongest arguments against bitcoin and shows how some succeed and most come up short.\",\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['When do political transitions lead to greater inclusion for groups historically excluded from power? Scholars and policymakers often assume the answer is simple: a transition will result in more inclusion when it ends in democracy. Yet this answer is incomplete at best, since many democracies systematically exclude women, particular ethnic groups, or lower economic classes from power. Using data on political transitions around the world from 1945 to 2014, this study shows that a political transition’s initiating force critically shapes post-transition political inclusion. When transitions are initiated through unarmed civil resistance campaigns they achieve greater advances in inclusion relative to other types of transition. We propose three mechanisms to explain this effect: civil resistance leads to greater continued mobilization and civic activism among the historically excluded, provides greater opportunities for elites from historically excluded groups to rise to positions of leadership in new regimes, and forges more pluralistic norms of political behavior.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Aspergillus fumigatus is the leading cause of aspergillosis, associated with high mortality rates, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. In search of novel genetic targets against aspergillosis, we studied the WOPR transcription factor OsaA. The deletion of the osaA gene resulted in colony growth reduction. Conidiation is also influenced by osaA; both osaA deletion and overexpression resulted in a decrease in spore production. Wild-type expression levels of osaA are necessary for the expression of the conidiation regulatory genes brlA, abaA, and wetA. In addition, osaA is necessary for normal cell wall integrity. Furthermore, the deletion of osaA resulted in a reduction in the ability of A. fumigatus to adhere to surfaces, decreased thermotolerance, as well as increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Metabolomics analysis indicated that osaA deletion or overexpression led to alterations in the production of multiple secondary metabolites, including gliotoxin. This was accompanied by changes in the expression of genes in the corresponding secondary metabolite gene clusters. These effects could be, at least in part, due to the observed reduction in the expression levels of the veA and laeA global regulators when the osaA locus was altered. Importantly, our study shows that osaA is indispensable for virulence in both neutropenic and corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mouse models.',\n",
       "   'ABSTRACT Velvet proteins, as well as the epigenetic regulator LaeA, are conserved in numerous fungal species, where, in response to environmental cues, they control several crucial cellular processes, including sexual and asexual morphogenesis, secondary metabolism, response to oxidative stress, and virulence. During the last two decades, knowledge of their mechanism of action as well as understanding their functional roles, has greatly increased, particularly in Aspergillus species. Research efforts from multiple groups followed, leading to the characterization of other Velvet and LaeA homologs in species of other fungal genera, including important opportunistic plant and animal pathogens. This review focuses mainly on the current knowledge of the role of Velvet and LaeA function in fungal pathogenesis. Velvet proteins and LaeA are unique to fungi, and for this reason, additional knowledge of these critical regulatory proteins will be important in the development of targeted control strategies to decrease the detrimental impact of fungal pathogens capable of causing disease in plants and animals.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['This paper presents a new model-based fault resilient control scheme for a class of nonlinear distributed parameter systems (DPS) represented by parabolic partial differential equations (PDE) in the presence of actuator faults. A Luenberger-like observer on the basis of nonlinear PDE representation of DPS is developed with boundary measurements. A detection residual is generated by taking the difference between the measured output of the DPS and the estimated one given by the observer. Once a fault is detected, an unknown actuator fault parameter vector together with a known basis function is utilized to adaptively estimate the fault dynamics. A novel tuning algorithm is derived to estimate the unknown actuator fault parameter vector. Next, in order to achieve resilience, the controller from the healthy scenario is adjusted to mitigate the faults by using both estimated fault dynamics and a secondary measurement. Subsequently, an explicit formula is developed to estimate the time-to-resilience (TTR). Finally, a nonlinear example is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.',\n",
       "   \"The paper introduces the 'Smart Handle', a compact, lightweight, fully solid-state control device based on machine learning (ML) models, enabling intuitive manipulation across all three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of translation and orientation. This handle-type control device utilizes low-cost, easily accessible sensors and materials. It addresses the need for natural control mechanisms in upper-extremity exoskeletons used in rehabilitation and occupational settings, offering position and orientation trajectories crucial for kinematic models. Additionally, individuals with motor difficulties using mobility chairs could benefit from its ability to learn and interpret diverse inputs as control commands. Through empirical study, it was demonstrated that the device adeptly learns and outputs continuous translation and rotation information from training sets focused on single DOF motions. Personalized calibration enables consistent movement classification with over 95% accuracy. Successful proof-of-concept experiments were conducted in exoskeleton and wheeled robot control applications, showcasing the Smart Handle's adaptability and reliability in diverse settings. This research underscores the device's potential across multiple domains, providing a foundation for enhanced intuitive control mechanisms in various technological applications.\",\n",

In this study, a transparent superhydrophobic coating was created by using a simple method that employed (3-glycidoxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (KH560) and 1,2-Bis (trimethoxysilyl) ethane (D26) as coupling agents and epoxy resin (E51) as an adhesive. The synergy between KH560 and D26 significantly improves the long-term outdoor durability, anti-icing, and anti-frosting performance of the superhydrophobic coating. The coating also has good acid and alkali resistance, UV resistance, and durability. The obtained SiO2@E51@KH560@D26 can delay the freezing time of water by 1974 s, much longer than bare glass (345 s) and also longer than the coatings with only D26 (932 s) or with only KH560 (1087 s). Moreover, the SiO2@E51@KH560@D26 showed an improved anti-frosting capability compared with the other three samples and better maintained its superhydrophobic properties at low temperatures. Our study proposes a potential method to fabricate a superhydrophobic coating with both anti-icing and anti-frosting properties.'],\n",

The purpose of the study is to investigate the long and rich history of attempts to differentiate spoken and written text in fields such as linguistics, communication, and rhetoric, which date back to the early 20th century. Given the availability of large quantities of machine-readable data and machine learning algorithms that can handle them, it is possible to use a large number of derived features. The research focuses on syntactic and lexical differences in written books and transcriptions of speeches by United States presidents. The analysis investigates morphological, lexical, syntactical, and text-level aspects. In this process, multiple features have been considered including lexical diversity, syllable count, frequency of parts of speech, and features relating to the parse tree, like the average length of noun phrases, and the use of interrogative sentences, among others. This study will enhance our understanding of the difference between written text and the transcription of spoken text in various disciplines including computer science, applied linguistics, communication, and similar fields.',\n",

There have been systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the use of antipsychotics in anxiety disorders, most of which focused on SGAs. Aims and objectives The specific aims of this umbrella review are to: (1) Evaluate the evidence of efficacy of FGAs and SGAs in anxiety disorders as an adjunctive treatment to traditional antidepressant treatments and other non- antipsychotic medications; (2) Compare monotherapy with antipsychotics to first-line treatments for anxiety disorders in terms of effectiveness, risks, and side effects. The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO. (CRD42021237436). Methods: An initial search was undertaken to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses from inception until 2020, with an updated search completed August 2021 and January 2023. The searches were conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), APA PsycInfo (Ovid), CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost), and the Cochrane Library through hand searches of references of included articles. Review quality was measured using the AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) scale. Results The original and updated searches yielded 1796 and 3744 articles respectively, of which 45 were eligible. After final review, 25 systematic reviews and meta- analyses were included in the analysis. Most of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses were deemed low-quality through AMSTAR-2 with only one review being deemed high-quality. In evaluating the monotherapies with antipsychotics compared to first-line treatments for anxiety disorder there was insufficient evidence due to experimental designs. There was limited evidence suggesting efficacy of antipsychotic agents in anxiety disorders other than quetiapine in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and monotherapy or augmentation with olanzapine in meta-analyses. Discussion and conclusions This umbrella review indicates a lack of high-quality studies of antipsychotics in anxiety disorders outside of the use of quetiapine in GAD. Although potentially effective for anxiety, FGAs and SGAs may have risks and side effects that outweigh their efficacy. Further long-term and larger-scale studies of antipsychotics in anxiety are needed. References Katzman MA, Bleau P, Blier P, Chokka P, Kjernisted K, Van Ameringen M, et al.

       "   'Abstract Background Although not approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders (except trifluoperazine) there is ongoing off‐label, unapproved use of first‐generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second‐generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for anxiety disorders. There have been systematic reviews and meta‐analyses on the use of antipsychotics in anxiety disorders, most of which focused on SGAs. Objective The specific aims of this umbrella review are to: (1) Evaluate the evidence of efficacy of FGAs and SGAs in anxiety disorders as an adjunctive treatment to traditional antidepressant treatments and other nonantipsychotic medications; (2) Compare monotherapy with antipsychotics to first‐line treatments for anxiety disorders in terms of effectiveness, risks, and side effects.

Most of the systematic reviews and meta‐analyses were deemed low‐quality through AMSTAR‐2 with only one review being deemed high‐quality. In evaluating the monotherapies with antipsychotics compared with first‐line treatments for anxiety disorder there was insufficient evidence due to flawed study designs (such as problems with randomization) and small sample sizes within studies. There was limited evidence suggesting efficacy of antipsychotic agents in anxiety disorders other than quetiapine in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Conclusions This umbrella review indicates a lack of high‐quality studies of antipsychotics in anxiety disorders outside of the use of quetiapine in GAD.

       "   'Abstract Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that can cause an individual significant chronic pain (CP). CP affects quality of life and daily functioning, yet there are limited effective treatments for CP within NF1. The current study describes the impact of CP using the Neurofibromatosis Pain Module (NFPM). The NFPM is a self‐reported clinical assessment that evaluates the impact of CP across multiple domains (e.g., interference, severity, tolerance, and symptomology) and three prioritized pain regions. A cross‐sectional study ( N = 242) asked adults with NF1 to describe and rate their pain using the NFPM. The results indicated that they reported moderate pain severity ( M = 6.6, SD = 2.0) on a 0–10 scale, that 54% ( n = 131) had been in pain at least 24 days in the last 30, for 75% ( n = 181) sleep was affected, and 16% reported that nothing was effective in reducing their CP for their primary pain region. The current results extend previously published work on CP within adults with NF1 and indicate that more emphasis on understanding and ameliorating CP is required. The NFPM is a sensitive clinical measure that provides qualitative and quantitative responses to inform medical providers about changes in CP.',\n",
       "   'Background: Childhood emotional abuse has been found to be significantly associated with exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs). One potential intervention for individuals exposed to childhood adverse and PMIEs is self-compassion. Objective: Explore the interplay between exposure to PMIEs, child emotional abuse and neglect, and self-compassion.Participants and Setting: 454 undergraduates at a midwestern university.Methods: Latent profile analysis was conducted to determine the optimal number of PMIE profiles. Multinomial logistic regression was run with posterior profile membership probabilities regressed on emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and self-compassion. Results: A three-profile (Low PMIE, Witness/Betrayal, High PMIE) model was identified. Compared to the High PMIEprofile, participants in the Witness/Betrayal profile were more likely to have higher self-compassion scores (OR = 1.052, 95% CI = 1.014–1.092, p = .006) and those in the Low PMIE profile were more likely to report lower emotional abuse (OR = .846, 95% CI = .791–.904, p < .001), lower emotional neglect (OR = .946, 95% CI = .898–.996, p = .036), and higher self-compassion (OR = 1.100, 95% CI = 1.057–1.145, p < .001). Compared to the Low PMIE profile, those in the Witness/Betrayal profile were more likely to have greater emotional abuse (OR = 1.174, 95% CI = 1.097–1.256, p < .001) and less self-compassion (OR = .956, 95% CI = .920–.995, p = .027).Conclusions: These findings contribute to the existing moral injury and childhood adversity literature and highlight self-compassion as an area of intervention.',\n",

       "   'Discourse analysis encompasses a variety of disciplinary approaches that broadly aim to understand how individuals and groups use language to construct and maintain their psychological and social realities. A central concept in discourse analysis is we all use discourse to accomplish our communication goals despite being unaware of most discourses we evoke. While discourse studies could help counseling professionals to better understand how they deploy discourses to maintain identities, inequalities, and status quo, the method is not well-represented in counseling research in the United States.

       "  'abstracts': ['Landscape ecology is an important subtopic of ecology. As a field, it is inherently interdisciplinary and provides opportunities to teach not only content, but transferable ecological and geographical skills. Given the broad spectrum of topics in general ecology courses, landscape ecology is often relegated to a single lecture or not covered at all, meaning that there is a need for concise, effective lesson content for teachers. Here, we present an adaptable, active lesson on landscape ecology that can be implemented to help address this gap and support student engagement and the application of content knowledge to local systems. Students are presented with an active lecture that introduces key concepts of landscape ecology, then presented with opportunities to apply and reinforce these concepts. First, students work in groups to solve applied challenges about a real environment. These group challenges support greater understanding, content retention, and engage students in collaborative creative problem-solving with their classmates. Second, students apply the concepts of the lesson to a natural space that they are familiar with to increase personal connections to the content and again reinforce the topics. This lesson has been implemented a total of three times in two courses across two universities with distinct student populations. Student feedback has been largely favorable, with students reporting increased understanding of the subject and enjoyment of the lesson, especially the group problem-solving challenges. We provide avenues for instructors to localize the content to help students connect to the topics using examples with which they are familiar. <em>Primary Image:</em>&nbsp;Group Problem-Solving in Practice: Resources (a map of potential purchase parcels, and a table with the price and a description of each of those parcels) given to students in a group problem-solving challenge that asks students to prioritize funds and maximize the positive impacts on the landscape by purchasing land for a nature preserve.',\n",
       "   'Including race, racism, and racial equity topics makes biology more relevant to society. Incentives to incorporate these topics are lacking, but anti-racist biology instructors are intrinsically motivated to incorporate these topics, and social injustice events make it a priority.

Zoom Pals was designed to provide an experiential learning opportunity for students while addressing social isolation for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A convenience sample of 18 adults with dementia residing in an LTCF, eight student volunteers, and three LTCF staff members participated. Results of this exploratory study showed active engagement and consistent communication across sessions for older adults, although individuals with mild dementia were more responsive than those in moderate stages. Themes from resident interviews included positive emotions, a sense of novelty, and decreased loneliness. Students endorsed significantly increased communication skills and comfort and a trend toward improved dementia knowledge. Students\\' post-experience surveys emphasized learning communication strategies, making a difference, empathy, reciprocal benefits, and realizing the complexity of a dementia diagnosis. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of delivering remote service learning and social interventions for adults with dementia and provides a useful road map for others interested in increasing their reach by adapting in-person group behavioral interventions for remote delivery.',\n",
       "   'Abstract The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia’s (ADRD) is rising rapidly with the aging of the baby boomer generation. A large workforce gap in dementia providers is widening with education as a frequently cited barrier to entry into the ADRD workforce (Mayer et al, 2023). This scoping review aimed to explore the extant literature on the use of service learning (SL) pedagogy related to ADRD in higher education settings for students in health-related majors. A systematic search was conducted using seven databases. Sources were included if participants were undergraduate/graduate students in any health-related discipline and if SL was utilized in conjunction with specific instructional paradigms (e.g., coursework, on-site workshops). SL, though individually defined by authors of included studies, was required to include community engagement with adults with ADRD; studies specific to clinical rotations were excluded. Included sources (n=32) were systematically extracted for characteristics including student demographics, SL components (learning instruction methods/training, experiences, reflection), and outcomes. Analysis of training revealed most ADRD SL paradigms relied on setting-specific training (n=15) over didactic academic instruction (n=7) or a combination (n=7). SL experiences ranged in type with informal activities (n=13) and creative arts (n=9) most commonly utilized to engage participants. The reflection component most commonly included open-ended reflective journals (n=15). Analysis revealed variability in how SL is represented in the literature. Despite this variability, sources frequently report SL as a viable option for educating the next generation of dementia service providers, with observed improvements in student attitudes and knowledge related to ADRD.'],\n",

Family caregivers of individuals with GBM must navigate a wide range of their care recipients’ physical, cognitive, and psychosocial deficits to provide effective care, which is both mentally and physically demanding. This study aimed to investigate the perspectives of family caregivers of GBM patients about the barriers and challenges they encounter when providing care to their care recipients. Methods Nineteen current and former family caregivers for individuals with GBM participated in semi-structured interviews from October 2023 through January 2024. We conducted interviews virtually and used applied thematic analysis to code transcripts to determine themes among participant responses. Results Three themes emerged from the interview analysis: (1) overwhelming caregiver burden, (2) difficulties coping with the caregiver role, and (3) gaps in caregiver support. These themes demonstrated a significant physical and mental toll on caregivers and a lack of time for engaging in coping strategies. The family caregivers described a lack of resources, minimal education, and limited time with their medical providers left them feeling ill-prepared for their role. Most family caregivers indicated their care recipients did not use rehabilitation services and the family caregivers expressed confusion about hospice and palliative care. Significance of results Family caregivers for individuals with GBM desire more straightforward and proactive information and education about their care recipients from their medical providers. There is an opportunity for more utilization of hospice, palliative, and rehabilitation services to provide necessary training to GBM patients and their caregivers.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['A substantial amount of the literature has examined the impact of participation in sport-based youth development programming and its global contribution to the lives of young people. In a similar vein, the outcomes of sport-based leadership programs are heavily influenced by the relationships and life skills acquired. One often overlooked demographic in this literature is incarcerated youth, a unique population who’s time spent in juvenile justice is fundamentally designed to prioritize rehabilitation and development. This paper sought to understand youths’ experiences in a sport-based leadership prison program with regards to content, relationship building, and transfer. This study included semi-structured interviews with three, currently incarcerated, adolescent black males, exploring their experiences as participants in their sport leadership program. Results included themes around the program meaning, relationship enhancers, and life skill learnings. Findings explore how sport-based prison programs may consider the importance of physical and psychological safety, relationship building, and life skill teachings as crucial components of a program that remain with participants well into their reintegration within society.',\n",
       "   \"In today's rapidly evolving educational environment, there is a pressing need to train teachers to respond to the increasingly diverse needs of students. Although physical education teacher education (PETE) programs across the country offer a wide variety of early field experiences for students, very few provide opportunities to work with currently incarcerated youths. One such partnership exists at Northern Illinois University (NIU), with a collaboration between the PETE program, the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice, and Project FLEX. Project FLEX is a physical activity and life skills program for incarcerated youths, one of the only current programs in the United States. The program's primary aims are to incorporate life skill content into sport programming that fosters the transfer of these skills outside of programming and to engage youth in activities that increased physical activity levels while encouraging improvements to their sedentary lifestyle. The purpose of this article is to highlight the partnership between Project FLEX, the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice, and the PETE program at NIU, discuss the partnership's impact on those involved, and share some potential future directions of the partnership. Further explanation of the interplay between the PETE program, the student's roles and responsibilities within Project FLEX, and how such early field experiences are currently situated within the PETE program will be discussed.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract Titanium (Ti) and Ti alloys are of great interest in bone and dental tissue engineering applications due to their biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and close mechanical properties to natural bone. However, the formation of fibrous tissue prevents osteointegration and results in implant loosening. Thus, physical and chemical methods are used to improve the surface properties of Ti. This study aimed to understand the role of alkali treatment conditions, including alkali medium concentration, temperature, rotation speed, and post-heat treatment. Our results showed that alkali treatment using 5 and 10 molar sodium hydroxide solution allows the formation of web-like microstructure. However, a higher concentration of 15 molar resulted in cracks along the surface. Interaction between the human fetal osteoblast cells (hfOBs) and Ti samples showed that heat treatment is necessary for increased cellular proliferation, which was not significantly different at later time points compared to the polished Ti. Alkali heat treatment did not induce inflammatory reactions at later time points. It showed an increase in vascular endothelial growth factor, osteoprotegerin/nuclear factor kappa-В ligand ratio, and osteocalcin expression, which is evidence for accelerated osteoblast cell maturation and bone remodeling in surface-modified samples. Together, these data show that alkali treatment using 5 or 10 molar of NaOH followed by heat treatment may have therapeutic effect and assist with bone tissue integration with Ti implant.'],\n",

Data comes from televised red-carpet interviews with celebrities as they arrive for popular award shows, such as the Oscars and the Golden Globes. Rather than a straightforward process of announcing or detecting the obvious, identifying emotions is an interactive and interpretive task. Admitting dislike or indifference for awards shows could violate emotion norms and damage one's reputation. Celebrities and their interviewers use culturally created vocabularies to impute emotions to themselves as well as to other individuals and groups, and adjust emotional claims in anticipation of audience expectations (while accounting for potential deviations from those expectations). Though celebrities' emotional identification took place in mass-mediated public occasions, similar processes seem to occur in many other settings.\"],\n",

       "   \"Abstract This research note addresses the overlooked and undertheorized gendered dimensions of rural-urban migration in the developing world. Drawing on Ester Boserup's (1970/2007) framework, a macro-social theory is offered that links historic agricultural divisions of labor to gendered patterns of urbanization. Specifically, it is argued that nations with a history of male farming systems (MFS) are more likely to produce economic and cultural conditions that facilitate women's rural-urban migration when compared to nations with a history of female farming systems (FFS). From this, the notion of “open” and “closed” urban systems is conceptualized to help identify and categorize the gendered urbanization histories of developing nations, which are linked to women's rights. Empirical support for the concepts and their association with women's rights is presented using mapped data from 138 developing nations from 1985 to 2015. A nation-level t-test of the interactive proxy measure between nation-level male-to-female urban population ratios and the degree of women's exclusion reveals a significant difference between nations with open and closed urban systems (p &amp;lt; 0.01).

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract This article explores the experiences of project directors at two‐year Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander serving institutions in the Midwest. Specifically, we examined how project directors faced racialized campus environments, navigated support structures (or the lack thereof), and continually combatted misperceptions about the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) communities and the Midwest. We discussed the isolation, myths, lack of institutional support, and campus climate for project directors and AA/PI communities. We end with recommendations.',\n",
       "   'Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) are considered models of excellence to support underrepresented racial and ethnic students; however, multiple definitions of MSIs complicate the consumption and production of research on these critical institutions. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) uses set criteria to define MSIs, based primarily on enrollment. However, scholars and practitioners have argued for considering factors beyond enrollment, such as equitable student outcomes and institutional markers of a serving culture. This study used descriptive analyses of IPEDS data to explore the extent to which MSIs served their target population. We use national weighted averages to report results on each MSI category compared to all other institutions. We found that MSIs enrolled higher percentages of MSI-aligned students and employed more-significant percentages of MSI-aligned instructional staff. Most MSIs generally retained higher percentages of MSI-aligned students. Most MSIs showed higher completion proportions, though nearly all MSI categories had lower graduation rates among MSI-aligned students. Some MSIs provided institutional aid to higher proportions of students; others provided lower proportions. Findings confirm that enrollment alone cannot be a proxy for servingness. We encourage researchers, practitioners, and government agencies to use more-holistic definitions. We make recommendations for government agencies to remove burdens to researching MSIs.'],\n",

       "   'The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the schooling processes in K-12 systems. Principals navigated many challenges both during remote online learning and after returning to in-person education. This study explored the processes that 11 charter high school principals experienced during the pandemic. Using thematic analysis of interview data from 11 school principals, researchers aimed to understand how urban school principals’ perceptions towards online education practices in underprivileged communities have changed towards both online learning and schooling in general during the covid-19 pandemic. The goal of this examination is to then make recommendations for systemic reform. Five themes emerged: 1) school principals’ differing experiences with online learning during the pandemic, 2) challenges and opportunities in transitioning to online learning during the pandemic, 3) equity problems, 4) perspectives of school principals on online learning during the pandemic, and 5) shifts in school principals’ perceptions of online learning. Findings suggest important implications for principals, district leaders, policymakers, and researchers.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Nasal vowels present a unique challenge to adult first language (L1) English speakers learning French as a second language (L2) due to the lack of phonemic distinction in their L1 as well as acoustic and articulatory factors that mute the salient phonetic differences. Perceiving the distinctions among French nasal vowels can thus represent a struggle for both L2 French learners and their teachers. Adding to this challenging situation, language teachers report a lack of time and expertise as reasons for neglecting pronunciation instruction. In this paper I evaluate the usefulness of online training modalities to confront the interrelated challenges of training nasal vowel distinctions in an experimental context and increasing effective pronunciation instruction in the classroom context. Taking the empirical perspective, I describe a study using high variability phonetic training (HVPT) embedded in online lessons to improve learners' ability to distinguish among French nasal vowels. Turning to the pedagogical perspective, I discuss the capacity of these asynchronous online platforms to provide effective pronunciation instruction in the L2 French classroom. Taken together, this discussion forms a critical analysis of online modalities in research and how they might be applied pedagogically as a means of mitigating their potential downsides.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Recent developments in \"water-in-salt\" electrolytes have precipitated a renewed effort to study imide-based electrolytes. While previous small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) studies have attributed the emergence of a low-Q peak in the SAXS profile of aqueous LiTFSI electrolytes to nanometer-scale anion clustering, a molecular-level understanding of the root of these clusters remains unclear. In this study, we combined molecular dynamics simulations and SAXS/WAXS to study the solvation structures of LiTFSI in acetonitrile, methanol, and water. We concluded that hydrogen bonding in water and MeOH stabilizes anion clusters, while nonpolar methyl groups on methanol and acetonitrile interrupt the nanoscale ordering of TFSI anions. This causes LiTFSI in water and MeOH electrolytes to exhibit two low-Q SAXS profile peaks while LiTFSI in acetonitrile exhibits only a single peak below Q = 1 Å–1. These findings shed light on the underlying molecular origins of nanoscale anion clusters, which may help in the design of the next generation of electrolyte chemistries.',\n",
       "   'Abstract Achieving durable lithium (Li) metal anodes in liquid electrolytes remains challenging, primarily due to the instability of the formed solid‐electrolyte interphases (SEIs). Modulating the Li‐ion solvation structures is pivotal in forming a stable SEI for stabilizing Li metal anodes. Here a strategy is developed to fine‐tune the Li‐ion solvation structures through enhanced dipole–dipole interactions between the Li‐ion‐coordinated solvent and the non‐Li‐ion‐coordinating diluent, for creating a stable SEI in the developed binary salt electrolyte. The enhanced dipole–dipole interactions weaken the coordination between Li‐ions and the solvents while strengthening the interaction between Li‐ions and dual anions, thereby facilitating the Li‐ion transport and a robust anion‐derived SEI with a distinct bilayer structure. Consequently, the developed electrolyte exhibited exceptional electrochemical performance in high energy‐density Li||LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NMC811) cells, with long calendar life, stable cyclability at 1 C, and reliable operation between 25 and −20 °C, and it also demonstrat remarkable cycling stability for a Li||NMC811 pouch cell with projected energy density of 402 Wh kg −1 , maintaining 80% capacity retention over 606 cycles under practical conditions.',\n",

       "   'The solvation structure of water-in-salt electrolytes was thoroughly studied, and two competing structures─anion solvated structure and anion network─were well-defined in recent publications. To further reveal the solvation structure in those highly concentrated electrolytes, particularly the influence of solvent, methanol was chosen as the solvent for this proposed study. In this work, small-angle X-ray scattering, small-angle neutron scattering, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were utilized to obtain the global and local structural information. With the concentration increment, the anion network formed by TFSI– became the dominant structure. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonds among methanol were interrupted by the TFSI– anion and formed a new connection with them. Molecular dynamic simulations with two different force fields (GAFF and OPLS-AA) are tested, and GAFF agreed with synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering/wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) results well and provided insightful information about molecular/ion scale solvation structure. This article not only deepens the understanding of the solvation structure in highly concentrated solutions, but more importantly, it provides additional strong evidence for utilizing SAXS/WAXS to validate molecular dynamics simulations.',\n",
       "   'Ammonia reforming of light alkane is conventionally employed for HCN production where coproduct H2 is burned for heating owing to the high reaction temperature (1200 °C) of such a highly endothermic process. Here, we show that a Ni3Ga1 intermetallic compound (IMC) catalyst is highly efficient for such a reaction, realizing efficient conversion of C1–C3 alkanes at 575–750 °C. This makes it feasible for on-purpose COx-free H2 production assuming that ammonia, as an H2 carrier, is ubiquitously available from renewable energy. At 650 °C and an alkane/ammonia ratio of 1/2, ethane and propane conversion of ∼20% and methane conversion of 13% were obtained (with nearly 100% HCN selectivity for methane and ethane) over the unsupported Ni3Ga1 IMC, which also shows high stability due to the absence of coke deposition. This breakthrough is achieved by employing a stoichiometric Ni3Ga1 mixed oxalate solid solution as the precursor for the Ni3Ga1 IMC.',\n",

       "   'Redox-active molecules, or redoxmers, in nonaqueous redox flow batteries often suffer from membrane crossover and low electrochemical stability. Transforming inorganic polyionic redoxmers established for aqueous batteries into nonaqueous candidates is an attractive strategy to address these challenges. Here we demonstrate such tailoring for hexacyanoferrate (HCF) by pairing the anions with tetra-n-butylammonium cation (TBA+). TBA3HCF has good solubility in acetonitrile and >1 V lower redox potential vs the aqueous counterpart; thus, the familiar aqueous catholyte becomes a new nonaqueous anolyte. The lowering of redox potential correlates with replacement of water by acetonitrile in the solvation shell of HCF, which can be traced to H-bond formation between water and cyanide ligands. Symmetric flow cells indicate exceptional stability of HCF polyanions in nonaqueous electrolytes and Nafion membranes completely block HCF crossover in full cells. Ion pairing of metal complexes with organic counterions can be effective for developing promising redoxmers for nonaqueous flow batteries.',\n",

       "   'Processive hydrogenolysis catalysts, in which a metal nanoparticle (e.g., Pt) embedded at the bottom of a cylindrical silica nanopore can repeatedly cleave polymer chains and produce value-added hydrocarbon products, offer a potential solution for billions of tons of waste plastics. As the chain stays longer near the Pt catalysts, it would have a higher chance of getting cut, and therefore the molecular weight distribution of the product could be affected by the adsorption behavior of virgin chains (long polymers) versus cleaved chains (short polymers) into the nanopores. This work reports a model study to understand the competitive adsorption behavior of the two different molecular weight polymers that are mixed, mimicking the reaction medium in the intermediate stage of the catalytic reaction. This study employs small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), which takes advantage of contrast differences between hydrogenous and deuterated polystyrenes to experimentally observe the relative composition of the two polymers in the silica nanopores. Our results reveal preferential adsorption of longer chains in the silica nanopores, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction in the literature for the case of the enthalpic attraction between polymers and pore walls.'],\n",

Objective: Evaluate effectiveness of a new 2-view abdominal radiograph exam protocol instituted to provide 24/7 coverage at 2 affiliated hospitals and replace the prior fluoroscopic G-tube contrast check exam. Materials and Methods: G-tube radiographic exams performed between December 2019 and May 2022 at 2 affiliated hospitals were identified and retrospective chart review was performed to delineate exam test yield, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity. Additional data collected included exam adherence to protocol, years of experience of the reporting pediatric radiologist, reporting time, and 30-day adverse events. Results: 227 exams were performed in 186 patients. 2-view radiograph protocol was followed in 81.9% (186/227); Additional radiograph views were performed in 18.1% (41/227); additional contrast volume in 9.3% (21/227). Reporting time under 1 hour occurred in 79.7% (181/227). 5.7% (13/227) exams were reported as indeterminate adding a median time delay of 40 minutes (IQR 90). Indeterminate exam reporting did not correlate with years of experience of the reporting pediatric radiologist (p=0.19); reporting time over 1 hour occurred more often in the after-hours group (p= 0.032). Fluoroscopic G-tube contrast check was requested in 8 of 13 indeterminate readings. Following reclassification of indeterminate exams based on clinical suspicion, test performance: yield 94.3%, accuracy 97.3%, sensitivity 81.8%, specificity 98.2%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 99.1%, Conclusion: This new diagnostic exam performed well with high test yield, accuracy, specificity and negative predictive value. The exam mostly followed protocol, allowed timely resumption of G-tube use, and provided a needed 24/7 remote coverage option for the new affiliated hospital.'],\n",

We found significant between-person variability in the growth trajectory of group cohesion and identified trainee self-disclosure and gender as significant predictors of group cohesion. The results indicated the complexity of within- and between-person changes in group cohesion in training groups and the need for further research to identify potential predictors of these changes.

       "  'abstracts': ['About 53 million adults in the United States offer informal care to family and friends with disease or disability. Such care has an estimated economic value of US $600 million. Most informal caregivers are not paid nor trained in caregiving, with many experiencing higher-than-average levels of stress and depression and lower levels of physical health. Some informal caregivers participate in web-based forums related to their caregiving role. This study aimed to explore how informal caregivers use easy-to-access caregiving web-based forums, including the types of information they share and seek from others. It also aimed to gain insights into the informal caregiver experience from the content these informal caregivers posted. The study population consisted of participants who posted on 5 web-based forums for informal caregivers between February and April 2024. Researchers extracted the first 6 responses to the first 20 questions and comments to appear posted by the informal caregivers in each of the 5 forums, removing any individually identifying information. We used a codebook thematic analysis approach to examine the data with Dedoose (SocioCultural Research Consultants). Researchers independently read all posts and coded the data. The author group discussed the codes, reiteratively refined them, and identified themes within the data. The data consisted of 100 initial posts and 600 responses. Over half of the initial posts included specific questions, with the remaining initial posts sharing experiences or reflections. Posts ranged in length from a sentence to more than 500 words. Domains identified included handling interpersonal challenges, navigating complicated systems, gathering tactical coping strategies, managing emotions, and connecting with others in similar situations. Negative interpersonal interactions were mentioned 123 times, with 77 posts describing challenging situations with extended family. Posters inquired about accessing resources, with health care and health insurance included 51 times, while legal and financial concerns were addressed 124 times. Caregiving challenges were mentioned hundreds of times, including discussion of hygiene (n=18), nutrition (n=21), and desire for a caregiving break (n=47). Posters expressed emotion in their comments 180 times, which included 32 mentions of guilt and 26 mentions of positive emotion. The importance of web-based group support was mentioned 301 times. Informal caregivers play an essential role in society. Many experience multifaceted challenges related to their caregiving role, and some turn to the internet for community. Accessing web-based discussion forums is a low-barrier method for informal caregivers to connect with others who may be experiencing similar emotions and challenges. Gaining a greater understanding of the ways informal caregivers seek advice and offer support to one another provides insight into the challenges they face. The domains identified on these forums may be helpful, as clinicians provide information to care recipients and their informal caregivers along their health journeys.',\n",
       "   \"The study evaluates the appropriateness and reliability of thyroid nodule cancer risk assessment recommendations provided by large language models (LLMs) ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude in alignment with clinical guidelines from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). A team comprising a medical imaging informatics specialist and two radiologists developed 24 clinically relevant questions based on ATA and NCCN guidelines. The readability of AI-generated responses was evaluated using the Readability Scoring System. A total of 322 radiologists in training or practice from the United States, recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk, assessed the AI responses. Quantitative analysis using SPSS measured the appropriateness of recommendations, while qualitative feedback was analyzed through Dedoose. The study compared the performance of three AI models ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude in providing appropriate recommendations. Paired samples t-tests showed no statistically significant differences in overall performance among the models. Claude achieved the highest mean score (21.84), followed closely by ChatGPT (21.83) and Gemini (21.47). Inappropriate response rates did not differ significantly, though Gemini showed a trend toward higher rates. However, ChatGPT achieved the highest accuracy (92.5%) in providing appropriate responses, followed by Claude (92.1%) and Gemini (90.4%). Qualitative feedback highlighted ChatGPT's clarity and structure, Gemini's accessibility but shallowness, and Claude's organization with occasional divergence from focus. LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude show potential in supporting thyroid nodule cancer risk assessment but require clinical oversight to ensure alignment with guidelines. Claude and ChatGPT performed nearly identically overall, with Claude having the highest mean score, though the difference was marginal. Further development is necessary to enhance their reliability for clinical use.\",\n",
       "   \"Background and Aims: Teleradiology is the practice of interpreting medical images acquired in an off-site location. Teleradiology has been utilized widely around the world to address the needs for subspecialty coverage, workload balancing, and as a solution for understaffing. This study aims to assess the perceptions of teleradiology among radiologists in Saudi Arabia, investigate any challenges they might face, and explore strategies that would help mitigate those challenges. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered electronic questionnaire was conducted to collect responses from radiologists practicing or having practiced teleradiology in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was conducted from January to June 2023, and 105 responses were included in the analysis. The responses were analyzed using chi-squared testing to investigate factors affecting the radiologists' perceptions. Results: The most common challenges for teleradiology were access to patients' health records, access to prior imaging exams, and concerns about image quality assurance. Around 74% of participants perceived teleradiology to be beneficial for geographic, after-hour, and subspecialties coverage. Teleradiology was also perceived to help reduce the turn-around time of radiology interpretations. Better communication with referring physicians and technologists was seen as a way to help improve teleradiology services. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the perception of teleradiology's challenges and benefits may not be influenced by experience, workplace, or subspecialty. Emphasis should be placed on the importance of quality assurance of images acquired remotely. Addressing the concerns and challenges related to access to patients' health records is also crucial to ensuring the successful implementation of teleradiology in the country.

       "   'Few studies have examined the association between green space and life expectancy, and only one study has looked at that data for small areas in the United States. These studies have found a positive association between green space and life expectancy. This study investigates the association between green space and small-area life expectancy in Chicago, a city in the United States with distinct environmental and socioeconomic characteristics and the largest U.S. life expectancy gap between neighborhoods. We conducted a spatial analysis using the green space metrics of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), park access, and tree canopy. Additionally, we included 18 lifestyle, environmental, and social covariates. Diagnostic analytics included multiple linear regression, Moran I test for spatial dependence, and principal component analysis with CAR Gaussian model. We performed a simulation to predict life expectancy gain if NDVI was brought to median levels. Our study revealed that after adjusting for covariates and spatial dependence (Moran I test p = 0.012) with a CAR Gaussian model, NDVI (credible interval = 0.292-0.894) demonstrated significance at a 5 % level, while tree canopy (credible interval = -0.404-0.109) and park access (credible interval = -0.258-0.161) did not. Excluding non-significant variables (tree canopy and park access) from the CAR Gaussian model, the median effect of NDVI on life expectancy was 0.491 (95 % credible interval: 0.24–0.718). Projecting this effect to tracts below the median NDVI predicted a gain of 476,000 years of life expectancy for Chicago residents. This study provides evidence that green space and LE are positively correlated, suggesting the potential to increase green space to address current LE gaps. Future research should investigate the mechanisms by which green space correlates to lifespan.',\n",
       "   'The increasing use of whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) examinations, also known as panCT, in emergency departments for trauma patients has raised concerns about potential over-use and the associated risk of unnecessary radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to examine the utilization patterns and findings of panCT scans performed over one year at a major academic hospital. This retrospective cohort study included 599 trauma patients (adults and pe-diatrics) who underwent panCT scans in 2023. De-identified data for each patient, including the radiology report, age, gender, and dose-length product (DLP), were retrieved and reviewed. Ra-diology reports were classified as negative (no acute traumatic injuries) or positive, with posi-tive cases further subclassified based on injury location. Injury severity scores (ISS) were also calculated based on the findings of the radiology reports. Statistical analysis was performed us-ing Python programming language to assess predictors of report findings. Overall, 56% of panCT scans were negative. Logistic regression showed that age significantly impacted the like-lihood of negative findings (p=0.009), while gender did not (p=0.182). One-third of positive cases showed injuries either in head and neck (H&amp;amp;N) or chest-abdomen-pelvis (CAP) regions. Most cases (70% adults, 65% pediatrics) had an ISS between 1 and 8. Median DLP values were 2264 mGy.cm in pediatrics and 2666 mGy.cm in adults. The study showed a high rate of negative panCT scans, suggesting potential overuse of panCT. These findings highlight the need for more selective CT imaging approaches, evidence-based guidelines, and decision-support tools to promote appropriate utilization of panCT scans, reducing unnecessary radiation exposure while ensuring high-risk patients receive appropriate imaging.',\n",
       "   'Introduction Ultrasound (US) measurements of kidney dimensions are essential for correlating with height, weight, and body mass index (BMI), establishing kidney size baselines, and assessing renal health. The global rise in obesity has increased interest in the links between BMI and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study investigates the relationship between renal dimensions (length, width, and thickness) and anthropometric measures (height, weight, and BMI) in a Saudi population. Material and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at two ultrasound clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with 129 participants (73 males and 56 females) aged 18–60 years. Kidney dimensions were measured using ultrasound machines. Spearman correlation assessed relationships between kidney dimensions and age, height, weight, and BMI, while the Mann-Whitney U test investigated sex differences. Results Significant correlations were identified between kidney dimensions and anthropometric measures. Age negatively correlated with kidney thickness for both kidneys (right: r = –0.502, p &lt; 0.0001; left: r = –0.542, p &lt; 0.0001) and left kidney width (r = –0.204, p = 0.020). Height positively correlated with all kidney dimensions. Weight also positively correlated with kidney dimensions. BMI showed positive correlations with right kidney length (r = 0.219, p = 0.013) and width (r = 0.319, p &lt; 0.0001), and left kidney length (r = 0.209, p = 0.018). Males had greater kidney thickness and left kidney width compared to females. Conclusions This study establishes significant correlations between renal dimensions and anthropometric measures in a Saudi population, highlighting the importance of considering individual characteristics in renal assessments. These findings support the development of personalized clinical guidelines for improved renal condition management.',\n",
       "   \"Background: Radiation therapy utilizes complex technologies to target tumors. Radiation therapy is not immune to human errors. Reporting medical errors and near misses is crucial to improving patient outcomes and ensuring the safety of future patients. Objective: This study aimed to measure the attitudes of radiotherapy staff members in Saudi Arabia regarding reporting errors and near misses in radiation therapy practice. It also examined the participants' reporting patterns and behaviors and explored the potential barriers to reporting errors and near misses as perceived by the participants. Methods: A cross-sectional study utilizing an online questionnaire was implemented. A sample of 70 health professionals working in radiation oncology departments in Saudi Arabia, including radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and radiotherapists, were recruited to participate in this study from January to June 2023. The data was analyzed using chi-squared testing to compare different groups, and the Kruskal–Wallis was used to find any statistically significant differences between different groups. Results: The study included 70 radiotherapy staff members. Professional roles did not significantly impact participants' decisions to report minor or major errors, with most consistently reporting errors to their supervisors regardless of role. The study revealed that fear of professional sanctions and the potential negative impact on a department's reputation are significant barriers to reporting errors or near misses. However, Only 17% of radiation oncologists did consider departmental sanctions as a barrier. Participants identified communication failure as the most significant source of errors in radiation oncology departments. The study also found a high level of agreement among the participants regarding the responsibility of reporting errors and near misses. Conclusion: The study investigated reporting errors and near misses in radiotherapy and considered the factors influencing them. The findings highlight the importance of effective communication and the implementation of an electronic reporting system.

       "   'Background and Objectives: Computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT KUB) is essential for evaluating urinary stones but also exposes patients to significant radiation. The scanning field should be minimized to only the necessary area to limit this radiation exposure. This study aims to assess the extent of CT KUB overscanning in renal colic procedures and identify the appropriate vertebral level for starting CT KUB scans. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 299 adult patients who underwent CT KUB examinations for kidney stone assessment was performed. To assess overscanning, the number of excess slices above the pole of the highest kidney and under the pubic symphysis was measured on the axial image of each patient. To allow for potential human error, a maximum acceptable level of overscanning was set at 10%. Results: This study found that only 31% of the scans met the target of less than 10% of overscanning superior to the highest kidney and inferior to the pubic symphysis. In comparison, overscanning was present in 69% of the scans, mainly at a superior level, resulting in higher radiation exposure for patients. Conclusions: A significant number of the scans exhibited unnecessary overscanning beyond the highest kidney, prompting us to propose using the upper border of the T10 vertebral body as a potential reference point to establish the upper margin for a CT KUB scan. This study suggests using T10 and the pubic symphysis as reliable landmarks to accurately determine the scan length. Starting CT KUB scans from the T10 vertebral body to the pubic symphysis allows for imaging of the entire urinary tract, minimizing unnecessary overscanning and reducing patient irradiation.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Abstract The goal was to evaluate the performance of a multi-sensor wrist-worn wearable device for generating 12 sleep measures in a diverse cohort. Our study technology was the sleep suite of the Verily Numetric Watch (VNW), using polysomnography (PSG) as reference during 1-night simultaneous recording in a sample of N=41 (18 male, age range: 18-78 years). We performed epoch-by-epoch comparisons for all measures. Key specific analyses were: core accuracy metrics for sleep vs wake classification; bias for continuous measures (Bland-Altman); Cohen’s kappa and accuracy for sleep stage classifications; and mean count difference and linearly weighted Cohen’s kappa for count metric. In addition, we performed subgroup analyses by sex, age, skin tone, body mass index, and arm hair density. Sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) of sleep versus wake classification were 0.97 (0.96, 0.98) and 0.66 (0.61, 0.71), respectively. Mean total sleep time bias was 14.55 minutes (1.61, 27.16); wake after sleep onset, −11.77 minutes (−23.89, 1.09); sleep efficiency, 3.15% (0.68, 5.57); sleep onset latency, −3.24 minutes (−9.38, 3.57); light-sleep duration, 3.78 minutes (−7.04, 15.06); deep-sleep duration, 3.91 minutes (−4.59, 12.60); rapid eye movement-sleep duration, 6.94 minutes (0.57, 13.04). Median difference for number of awakenings, 0.00 (0.00, 1.00); and overall accuracy of sleep stage classification, 0.78 (0.51, 0.88). Most measures showed statistically significant proportional biases and/or heteroscedasticity. Subgroup results appeared largely consistent with the overall group, although small samples preclude strong conclusions. These results support the use of VNW’s in classifying sleep versus wake, sleep stages, and for related overnight sleep measures.',\n",

Methods We collected data from 41 adults without obstructive sleep apnea or insomnia during a single overnight laboratory visit. We evaluated epoch-by-epoch performance for sleep versus wake classification, sleep stage classification and duration, total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), and number of awakenings (NAWK). Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, Cohen’s kappa, and Bland-Altman analyses. Results Sensitivity and specificity (95% CIs) of sleep versus wake classification were 0.97 (0.96, 0.98) and 0.70 (0.66, 0.74), respectively. Cohen’s kappa (95% CI) for 4-class stage detection was 0.64 (0.18, 0.82). Most VSW sleep measures had proportional bias. The mean bias values (95% CI) were 14.0 minutes (5.55, 23.20) for TST, - 13.1 minutes (-21.33, -6.21) for WASO, 2.97% (1.25, 4.84) for SE, -1.34 minutes (-7.29, 4.81) for SOL, 1.91 minutes (-8.28, 11.98) for light sleep duration, 5.24 minutes (-3.35, 14.13) for deep sleep duration, and 6.39 minutes (-0.68, 13.18) for REM sleep duration. Mean and median NAWK count differences (95% CI) were 0.05 (-0.42, 0.53) and 0.0 (0.0, 0.0), respectively. Discussion Results support applying the VSW to track overnight sleep measures in free-living settings. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT05276362 ).',\n",
       "   \"Introduction This study evaluated the performance of a wrist-worn wearable, Verily Study Watch (VSW), in detecting key sleep measures against polysomnography (PSG). Methods We collected data from 41 adults without obstructive sleep apnea or insomnia during a single overnight laboratory visit. We evaluated epoch-by-epoch performance for sleep vs. wake classification, sleep stage classification and duration, total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE), and number of awakenings (NAWK). Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa, and Bland-Altman analyses. Results Sensitivity and specificity (95% CIs) of sleep vs. wake classification were 0.97 (0.96, 0.98) and 0.70 (0.66, 0.74), respectively. Cohen's kappa (95% CI) for 4-class stage detection was 0.64 (0.18, 0.82). Most VSW sleep measures had proportional bias. The mean bias values (95% CI) were 14.0 min (5.55, 23.20) for TST, −13.1 min (−21.33, −6.21) for WASO, 2.97% (1.25, 4.84) for SE, −1.34 min (−7.29, 4.81) for SOL, 1.91 min (−8.28, 11.98) for light sleep duration, 5.24 min (−3.35, 14.13) for deep sleep duration, and 6.39 min (−0.68, 13.18) for REM sleep duration.

       "  'abstracts': ['The persistence of mutual fund alphas is often viewed as evidence that some funds possess skill and that this skill persists. This interpretation is unwarranted when security factor lines are too flat. A sort on estimated alphas is a sort against betas: high-alpha funds are predominantly low-beta funds and vice versa. Thus, a strategy of investing in high-alpha funds benefits not from skill, but from a betting-against-multiple-betas effect. In-sample tests intended to separate luck from skill are similarly biased. We demonstrate this bias through simulations and show that applying a correction factor eliminates much of the apparent skill in mutual fund data.'],\n",

Yet, many teacher preparation programs continue to function in a medical model of disability, where teacher educators teach candidates to “fix” or “cure” young disabled children. Working from a medical model of disability positions young disabled children as problematic and ostracizes disabled teacher candidates as they see themselves in the very children spoken of by their teacher educators. Instead, practices can be implemented to build on the unique strengths and assets disabled teacher candidates bring to the early childhood field. This call to action has been co-authored by disabled teachers and candidates to highlight the practices teacher educators can instill in their programs with the goal of recruiting and retaining disabled teacher candidates.'],\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

Grounded in reflective practice, intersectionality, and critical pedagogy, their collaborative endeavor necessitated profound self‐examination and recognition of oppressive structures inherent within the field and reproduced throughout course syllabi, thereby perpetuating societal inequities inside and outside the classroom context. Their iterative, evolving effort resembled a reflective consultation group, marked by continuous self‐reflection, challenging assumptions, and transforming actions, vividly portrayed in their vignettes. A nonlinear spiral model emerged as a visual representation of the multiple entry points into an ongoing process—highlighting access points that encourage curiosity and interrogation of academic syllabi and course content. The inclusive nature of this inquiry invites faculty members and practitioners to confront racism, ableism, and other systems of domination, amplify marginalized scholarship, and redefine early childhood education‐related fields, including the Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health landscape. It also underscores the imperative of sustained introspection and collaborative action in nurturing equity.',\n",
       "   \"This chapter chronicles the transformative journey of a group of early childhood education (ECE) teacher educators as they critically examined the construction of early childhood teacher preparation courses. Rooted in critical pedagogy, their process demanded deep self-reflection and an acknowledgement of the oppressive systems within the field. Initially pursuing a linear checklist approach to cultivating inclusive practices, the team's extensive discussions and readings revealed the limitations of this method. Instead, they embraced a non-linear, formative spiral model, reflecting ongoing learning and reflection over time. Divided into four elements–identity and self-reflection, course syllabi, course design, and course content–-their approach aims to inspire faculty to confront biases, elevate marginalized voices, and reshape the ECE landscape. The authors invite readers into this ongoing journey, emphasizing the need for continuous introspection and collective effort to foster equity and inclusion in ECE.\",\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Caffeine is a natural compound that inhibits the major cellular signaling regulator target of rapamycin (TOR), leading to widespread effects including growth inhibition. Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast can adapt to tolerate high concentrations of caffeine in coffee and cacao fermentations and in experimental systems. While many factors affecting caffeine tolerance and TOR signaling have been identified, further characterization of their interactions and regulation remain to be studied. We used experimental evolution of S. cerevisiae to study the genetic contributions to caffeine tolerance in yeast, through a collaboration between high school students evolving yeast populations coupled with further research exploration in university labs. We identified multiple evolved yeast populations with mutations in PDR1 and PDR5, which contribute to multidrug resistance, and showed that gain-of-function mutations in multidrug resistance family transcription factors Pdr1, Pdr3, and Yrr1 differentially contribute to caffeine tolerance. We also identified loss-of-function mutations in TOR effectors Sit4, Sky1, and Tip41 and showed that these mutations contribute to caffeine tolerance. These findings support the importance of both the multidrug resistance family and TOR signaling in caffeine tolerance and can inform future exploration of networks affected by caffeine and other TOR inhibitors in model systems and industrial applications.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['This study presents a systematic review of the 122 studies on citizen satisfaction in the field of public administration. The research aims to identify the current state of knowledge on citizen satisfaction by drawing on existing empirical results and conceptual arguments, highlighting research gaps, and developing a heuristic framework to guide future research. Based on a literature search of 12 major public administration journals, our findings indicate that citizen satisfaction has gained significant academic attention as a performance measure to monitor and assess public service delivery, particularly at the local level. Despite substantial scrutiny in diverse research contexts, quantitative studies still predominate, mainly using secondary survey data in their research. Furthermore, we observed an absence of an agreed-upon definition for citizen satisfaction and an over-emphasis on the expectancy-disconfirmation model to explain the satisfaction process, highlighting the need for scholars to move beyond the performance-expectation dyad. While reviewing a set of environmental, organizational, and individual-level antecedents and outcomes, we noticed few scholars have considered the effects of moderating variables on citizen satisfaction. As such, our paper concludes by identifying a few underexplored research themes that could facilitate knowledge-building regarding citizen satisfaction.'],\n",

The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"The multidimensional nature of bilingualism demands ecologically valid and inclusive research methods that can capture its dynamism and diversity. This is particularly relevant when assessing language proficiency in minoritized and racialized communities, including heritage speakers (HSs). Motivated by a paradigm shift in bilingualism research, the present study joined current efforts to establish best practices for assessing language proficiency among bilingual individuals accurately and consistently, promoting ecological validity and inclusivity. Specifically, we examined the reliability and validity of objective and subjective proficiency assessments ubiquitously used in second language (L2) and bilingualism research to assess Spanish proficiency, within a sample of HSs of Spanish in the United States (US). We also sought to understand the relationships between these proficiency assessments and a subset of heritage language (HL) experience factors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the reliability and validity of these proficiency assessments and their relationship with HL experience factors with HSs of Spanish in the US in a multidimensional way. Forty-three HSs of Spanish completed the Bilingual Language Profile questionnaire, including self-reports of proficiency and information about HL experience and two objective proficiency assessments: a lexical decision task, namely the LexTale-Esp, and a vocabulary and grammar task, often referred to as the “Modified DELE”. Our findings revealed high internal consistency for both objective proficiency assessments and medium correlations between them, supporting their reliability and validity. However, our results also revealed inconsistent relationships between subjective proficiency assessments and HL language experience factors. These findings underscore the dynamic interplay between these HSs' objective and subjective proficiency, and HL experiences and use across different contexts. Additionally, they highlight the limitations of relying on any single proficiency assessment, aligning with previous research that emphasizes the need for multidimensional proficiency assessments and language experience factors to capture the dynamic and diverse nature of bilingualism. By critically evaluating the reliability and validity of existing objective and subjective proficiency assessments alongside HL experience factors, our study aims to shed light on the best practices of assessing language proficiency among bilingual individuals, specifically HSs of Spanish in the US, in an ecologically valid and inclusive manner.\"],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Isomorphism and homomorphism are fundamental topics in abstract algebra, but how mathematicians characterise the utility of these concepts remains understudied. Based on interviews with nine research-active mathematicians, we confirmed use of previously noted conceptual metaphors and noted new metaphors and metaphor clusters. We expand on prior work by highlighting five thematic contrasts between metaphors for these concepts: context dependent sameness, classification of objects versus computing maps, indistinguishable versus distinct objects, structure-preservation versus structure loss, and information gain versus structure loss. Implications include the centrality of sameness to thinking about isomorphism and homomorphism but the need for care in how that sameness is framed; the value of being able to attend to the object and map; the importance of being able to determine which structures are preserved and which are lost in context; and the existence of a conceptual purpose for homomorphism as a tool for changing perspectives.',\n",
       "   'Mathematics education research has long focused on students’ conceptual understanding, including highlighting conceptions viewed as problematic and looking for ways to develop more desirable conceptions. Nevertheless, limited research has examined how mathematicians characterize understanding of concepts and definitions or promote activities beneficial for students. Based on interviews with 13 mathematicians, we present thematic characterizations of what it means to understand a concept and definition, highlight activities mathematicians believe assist students’ learning, and examine their reasons for promoting these activities. Results include mathematically grounded descriptions of what it means to understand a concept but general descriptions of approaching and supporting learning. Implications include a need for attending to intended meanings for “understanding” in context and how this impacts appropriate activities for developing understanding, as well as a careful examination of the extant research literature’s claims about seemingly unified notions of conceptual understanding.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['New calorimeter technology is being developed for future collider experiments. We are developing a calorimeter that integrates two technologies, a high-granularity calorimeter and a dual-readout calorimeter, and has high time resolution at a picosecond level. The proposed calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter based on scintillation and Cherenkov detectors with high-granularity readout. The Cherenkov detector has a picosecond level time resolution. For the high-granularity scintillation detector, scintillator strips of 300mm × 30mm ×3mm-thick are aligned horizontally and vertically to realize an effective 30mm-square-cell segmentation. Prototype strips with different designs and scintillator materials were tested to compare the performance.',\n",
       "   'We are developing a Cherenkov detector aiming for applications in the next-generation calorimetry. It is a calorimetry that combines dual-readout and high-granularity with excellent timing capability. This work is to prove the concept of the Cherenkov detector utilizing a resistive plate chamber (RPC) with Diamond-Like Carbon as resistive electrode. The first prototype was tested with β-rays and cosmic-rays. This paper discusses the behavior of the charge spectrum and the time resolution of the first prototype.',\n",
       "   'Dual-readout and particle flow algorithm (PFA) are technologies proposed for precise jet energy measurement in future colliders. While PFA requires highly granular calorimeters, dual-readout has mainly been used with fiber-based calorimeters that do not have highly segmented capabilities. It is still non-trivial to combine these two technologies in one calorimeter system because of the use of fibers in most of the dualreadout calorimeters, which is not compatible with the high granularity requirement of PFA technologies. The aim of this study is to develop a novel calorimetry that combines dual-readout and PFA by adopting a highly segmented tile-based configuration. This paper compares the improvement of energy resolution using dual-readout approach across several configurations of highly granular hadron calorimeters through simulation. Results indicate that setups with fine sampling and close placement of scintillators and Cherenkov detectors improve dual-readout performance.',\n",

       "   'A comprehensive multi-jet physics program is anticipated for experiments at future colliders. Key physics processes necessitate detectors that can distinguish signals from W and Z bosons and the Higgs boson. Typical examples include channels with W+W− or ZoZo pairs and processes involving new physics in those cases where neutral particles must be disentangled from charged ones due to the presence of W or Z bosons in their final states. Such a physics program demands calorimetric energy resolution at or beyond the limits of traditional calorimetric techniques. Multiple-readout calorimetry, which aims to reduce fluctuations in energy measurements of hadronic showers, is a promising approach. The first part of this article reviews dual- and triple-readout calorimetry within a mathematical framework describing the underlying compensating mechanism. The second part proposes a potential implementation using an integrally active and total absorption detector. This model serves as the basis for several Monte Carlo studies, illustrating how the response of a multiple-readout calorimeter depends on construction parameters. Among the layouts considered, one configuration operating in triple-readout mode shows the potential to achieve an energy resolution approaching 20%/E.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['A neural network for software compensation was developed for the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL). The neural network uses spatial and temporal event information from the AHCAL and energy information, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and the neutron fraction of the hadron shower. The neural network method produced a depth-dependent energy weighting and a time-dependent threshold for enhancing energy deposits consistent with the timescale of evaporation neutrons. Additionally, it was observed to learn an energy-weighting indicative of longitudinal leakage correction. In addition, the method produced a linear detector response and outperformed a published control method regarding resolution for every particle energy studied.',\n",
       "   'To achieve state-of-the-art jet energy resolution for Particle Flow, sophisticated energy clustering algorithms must be developed that can fully exploit available information to separate energy deposits from charged and neutral particles. Three published neural network-based shower separation models were applied to simulation and experimental data to measure the performance of the highly granular CALICE Analogue Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype in distinguishing the energy deposited by a single charged and single neutral hadron for Particle Flow. The performance of models trained using only standard spatial and energy and charged track position information from an event was compared to models trained using timing information available from AHCAL, which is expected to improve sensitivity to shower development and, therefore, aid in clustering. Both simulation and experimental data were used to train and test the models and their performances were compared. The best-performing neural network achieved significantly superior event reconstruction when timing information was utilised in training for the case where the charged hadron had more energy than the neutral one, motivating temporally sensitive calorimeters. All models under test were observed to tend to allocate energy deposited by the more energetic of the two showers to the less energetic one. Similar shower reconstruction performance was observed for a model trained on simulation and applied to data and a model trained and applied to data.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"Summary Researchers have cited the need to account for subordinates in the leadership process, and the leader–team fit paradigm provides a framework for simultaneously considering the characteristics of leaders and those of their subordinate teams. Drawing on extraversion personality theory stipulating extraversion's implications on motivation and communication styles and preferences, we seek to add nuance to the study of a trait that has been widely assumed to exert positive effects in leaders and teams. Integrating theorizing on extraversion and fit, we posit in this research that counterproductive leader and team behaviors will be associated with misfit leader–team pairings in which extraversion incongruence exists (leaders higher in extraversion paired with teams lower in extraversion or leaders lower in extraversion paired with teams higher in extraversion). We test our predictions in a time‐lagged field survey study of leaders and their respective teams in the nuclear power industry, using polynomial regression analyses to find support for hypotheses about the association of leader–team extraversion incongruence and detrimental leader (use of pressure influence tactics) and team (deviance directed at the organization) behaviors. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice on leaders, teams, deviance, and extraversion.\"],\n",

       "   'Abstract Burial pressures (depths) within mountain belts place fundamental constraints on the growth and stabilization of continental crust. We report precise metamorphic pressures for ca. 1.7 Ga rocks from the Upper Granite Gorge (UGG) of the Grand Canyon (southwestern United States) and, for the first time, resolve pressure variations across this continuous exposure of mid-crustal rocks. We applied quartz-in-garnet (QuiG) barometry and pseudosection modeling to determine pressures in domains (“blocks”) with evidence of higher and lower peak metamorphic grades. New pressure-temperature (P-T) paths constructed using this integrated approach show that a hot block sample reached 7 kbar and a cold block sample never surpassed 5 kbar, revealing an ~2 kbar P difference between hot and cold blocks and delineating distinct P-T paths for these domains in the UGG. Our findings suggest that hot and cold blocks were likely metamorphosed at different crustal levels within a pre-Yavapai, Paleoproterozoic orogen and were subsequently juxtaposed during and/or after the Yavapai Orogeny at mid-crustal levels. The deformation that produced differential vertical displacement of crustal blocks post-dated peak metamorphism and could reflect extensional collapse of a large orogen and/or renewed folding and thrusting at the Paleoproterozoic Laurentian plate margin.',\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Background There is substantial research evidence to suggest that supported employment is an evidence-based mental health and employment intervention for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and persons with severe mental illness (SMI). The effectiveness of supported employment may also extend to people recovering from addiction because alcohol and substance use disorder is considered a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR). However, there is a paucity of research validating the effectiveness of supported employment for individuals recovering from addiction. Objective This study examined the effect of supported employment on the employment outcomes of individuals recovering from addiction in the state vocational rehabilitation system. Method We conducted a case-control study using propensity score matching to create a treatment group (individuals recovering from addiction who received supported employment) and a control group (individuals recovering from addiction who did not receive supported employment), using data extracted from the Rehabilitation Services Administration Case Service Report database. Chi-square tests and t-tests were computed to determine if there were any differences between the treatment and control groups on employment outcomes and quality of employment. Results Individuals recovering from addiction in the treatment group had significantly higher employment rates than those in the control group. Conclusion Supported employment is an effective employment intervention for individuals recovering from addiction receiving services from the state vocational rehabilitation system.'],\n",

Disciplinary literacy is based on a premise of access to advanced ways of thinking and doing as contextualized by individual disciplines. The authors put forth a framework of disciplinary literacy that combines habits of thinking such as thinking strategies, habits of practice or the actions experts engage in, beliefs experts hold about the discipline, and language use and vocabulary in the discipline. Disciplinary literacy in the classroom utilizes all these components to help students read, write, and think similar to ways that experts do in order to help them move past memorizing information and instead engage in authentic disciplinary argumentation and problem solving.\"],\n",

       "   \"Abstract In order to better understand whether and how college students use certain textbook reading strategies, this project employed several important methods in concert, including a textbook reading strategy inventory that focused on frequency of strategy use, eye‐movement recordings of participants reading college textbook excerpts, and think‐aloud sessions in which participants viewed their own eye‐movement recordings and used them as a stimulus to engage in a structured retrospective think‐aloud about their own reading approach and strategies. Salient findings include participants' emerging articulations about the observable reading strategies they identified themselves implementing, discrepancies in their assumptions about their reading strategies and what they actually employed, and the sometimes surprising (to the participant) strategies they used to navigate these textbook excerpts.\",\n",
       "   'Abstract In this article, we argue that the goal of reading literary text is the creation of interpretation, and we advocate for a research‐based disciplinary literacy heuristic that centers on reading and interpreting literary text. The heuristic serves as a guide for designing instruction that incorporates important instructional principles for English/Language Arts: acceptance of literary ambiguity, use of collaborative discussion, and adoption of asset‐based approaches. We unpack the heuristic and recommend instructional approaches that center student voices in the process of interpreting literary texts, supporting them to learn not only how literature works, but also how to engage in their own interpretations.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': [\"This paper explores what people expect from AI-human collaboration in a creative domain and how they react when the outcomes fall short of those expectations. Study 1 utilized open-ended questions and content analysis to establish that consumers expect ads created through AI-human collaboration to be of superior quality compared to those created through AI-AI or human-human collaboration. This expectation arises from consumers' beliefs in enhanced informational task management, the generation of innovative ideas, improved creative research, and greater efficiency in collaboration when AI and humans work together. Given these high expectations, Study 2, conducted in an experimental setting, reveals that consumers evaluate subpar ads produced through AI-human collaboration more negatively due to negative expectancy disconfirmation. Study 3 further examines individual differences as a moderating factor, demonstrating that the negative impact of expectancy disconfirmation is more pronounced among individuals with higher expectations of AI-human collaboration superiority.\",\n",
       "   'Purpose The current study examines a novel model that examines how the online and offline or general personality of the same person predicts social identification with the endorser in a message and their subsequent online behaviors (e.g. ad-skipping) on social media, both differentially and simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach Real-time ad-skipping behaviors were tracked and analyzed across three online experiments. Findings The results supported the model explicating the dual and simultaneous influence of offline and online personalities on ad-skipping behaviors. Specifically, in response to a skippable video ad, online and offline personalities respectively increase and decrease viewers’ identification with the endorser. Consequently, the higher or lower the identification, the lower or higher the rate of ad-skipping behaviors. Research limitations/implications The current study will benefit from a larger set of real-world data (i.e. big data) to enhance the generalizability of the findings, supporting the model. Practical implications With the growing prevalence of the gap between online and offline self-identities driven by social media usage, this paper suggests that the ad message needs to address the dual influence of both online and offline identities on ad-skipping behaviors. Originality/value The current study tests a novel model that shows that the online and offline personalities of the same person concurrently influence one’s behavior on the Internet, rather than separately.'],\n",

       "  'abstracts': ['Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic contributed to substantial advancement in digital technologies in health care. Health-care professionals involved in respiratory care can now tailor their therapy for their patients with asthma, who still account for &gt;1 million emergency department visits annually, with remote monitoring services. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) and remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) are both ways to help patients with chronic asthma and other patients who need respiratory monitoring in pulmonary and in allergy and immunology clinics. RPM and RTM allow clinicians to gain further understanding as to what is going on in the patient’s home on a regular basis. Objectives: To ensure that the populations to monitor are correctly identified, privacy and security measures are in place, staffing resources are sufficient, and billing practices are understood before initiating RPM and RTM. Methods: A review of the current literature (2019‐2023) for RPM and RTM from PubMed, National Center of Biotechnical Information, American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as practical experiences are outlined to provide an easy-to-follow guide for implementation in practice. Results: RPM and RTM services help identify and address gaps in care for patients such as patients with uncontrolled asthma and to assist with populations of need such as the underserved, the elderly, and rural populations. Conclusion: As artificial intelligence and other technologies continue to grow in the healthcare space, remote monitoring services are expected to transform health-care delivery to new heights yet to be seen.'],\n",
